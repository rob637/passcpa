### 🗣️ The Script

**(0:00-0:45) The Hook**  
**[Visual: VIS_SCORP_01]**  
"Welcome back. Today we are tackling the number one reason students fail Part 2 of the EA exam: S-Corp Basis. Specifically, the 'Debt Trap'.
Here is the scenario: Your client, Bob, guarantees a $100,000 bank loan for his struggling S-Corp. He thinks he can now deduct $100,000 of losses.
The IRS says: 'Absolutely not.' Bob has zero basis. Bob is angry.
By the end of this ten-minute session, you will understand exactly why Bob is wrong, and how to fix it so he *can* take that deduction."

**(0:45-3:30) Core Concept: Stock vs. Debt**  
**[Visual: VIS_SCORP_02]**  
"Unlike partnerships, S-Corporations have two distinct buckets of basis: Stock Basis and Debt Basis.
Stock Basis is what you paid for the stock, plus income, minus distributions. Think of this as your 'Equity'.
Debt Basis is created *only* when you, the shareholder, loan *actual money* directly to the corporation.
**[Visual: VIS_SCORP_03]**  
This is the 'Economic Outlay' doctrine. If cash didn't leave your personal bank account and land in the company account, you do not have basis. A guarantee is just a promise, not an outlay. That is why Bob's guarantee sits at zero."

**(3:30-6:00) The Ordering Rules**  
**[Visual: VIS_SCORP_04]**  
"Now, let's talk about the 'Ordering Rules'. The IRS forces us to adjust basis in a specific order every year. Memorize this acronym: **I.D.L.**
1. **I**ncome items (increase basis first). Explain why this matters: It might make a distribution tax-free!
2. **D**istributions (reduce basis next). We take cash out before we calculate losses.
3. **L**osses (reduce basis last).
If you mess up this order, you will calculate the wrong taxability for the distribution and the wrong allowable loss."

**(6:00-8:30) The Example**  
**[Visual: Calculations on Whiteboard]**  
"Let's run the numbers.
Bob starts with $10,000 Stock Basis.
The company loses $50,000 this year.
Bob also loans the company $20,000 of his own cash.
Total Loss Capacity = $10,000 (Stock) + $20,000 (Debt) = $30,000.
He deducts $30,000. The remaining $20,000 of loss is Suspended.
Crucial Point: When the company becomes profitable next year, which basis do we restore first? We restore **Debt Basis** first, then Stock Basis."

**(8:30-10:00) Exam Tip & Outro**  
"Here is your final exam tip: If a question asks about a 'Non-Dividend Distribution', remember that it is tax-free ONLY up to the amount of **Stock Basis**. Debt basis does *not* help you with distributions; it only helps you with losses.
Go try the simulation on S-Corp Basis now. You need to see the 'Ordering Rules' in action to make it stick. I'll see you in the next lesson."

## 🎬 Lesson 2: Partnership Basis (Inside vs. Outside)
**ID:** SEE2-006  
**Topic:** Understanding the difference between a partner's basis in the interest and the partnership's basis in assets.

### 🖼️ Visual Asset List
| Asset ID | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `VIS_PART_01` | **Illustration** | A clear wall separating "Inside" (Building/Assets) and "Outside" (Partner's Wallet). |
| `VIS_PART_02` | **Formula** | The "BASE" formula: Beginning + Additions - Subtractions = Ending. |
| `VIS_PART_03` | **Warning** | "Liabilities = Basis" (The key difference from S-Corps). |

### 🗣️ The Script

**(0:00-1:00) The Hook**  
**[Visual: VIS_PART_01]**  
"In the last video, we said S-Corp shareholders don't get basis for bank loans. Well, throw that rule out the window.
Welcome to Partnership taxation, where *liabilities are your friend*.
Today we define the 'Two Worlds': Inside Basis and Outside Basis. If you mix these up on the exam, you will fail the simulations. Let's keep them straight."

**(1:00-4:00) The Concept: Liabilities**  
**[Visual: VIS_PART_03]**  
"In a partnership, every partner is personally liable (in a GP) or economically at risk. Therefore, when the partnership takes out a $1,000,000 loan, the partners get to increase their 'Outside Basis' by their share of that loan.
This is huge. It means you can deduct losses *greater* than your cash investment, funded entirely by bank debt. This is why real estate investors love partnerships."

**(4:00-7:00) Calculating Outside Basis**  
**[Visual: VIS_PART_02]**  
"We use the 'BASE' mnemonic for the running tally:
**B**eginning Basis
**A**dd: Contributions + Income + **Increase in Liabilities**
**S**ubtract: Distributions - Losses - **Decrease in Liabilities**
**E**nding Basis
Pay close attention to that liability line. If the partnership pays off debt, your basis goes DOWN. This is a \"Deemed Distribution.\" If you aren't careful, paying off a loan can actually trigger a taxable gain for a partner! It sounds crazy, but it's the law."

**(7:00-9:00) Scenario Walkthrough**  
"Imagine Alice contributes land worth $100,000 with a mortgage of $80,000.
Her initial Gross Basis is $100,000.
BUT, the partnership assumes the $80,000 debt. That debt is split 50/50 with her partner Bob.
Alice is *relieved* of $40,000 of debt (Bob's half).
So, Alice's basis is: $100k (Land) - $40k (Debt Relief) = $60,000.
Bob has $0 cash in, but he assumes $40k of debt. His basis is $40,000.
This 'Netting' of liabilities is the most tested calculation."

**(9:00-10:00) Outro**  
"Remember: S-Corps hate debt basis; Partnerships love it.
Next time you see a question about 'assumption of liabilities,' draw a T-account.
Up next, we'll talk about Section 754 elections—the bridge between Inside and Outside basis."

## 🎬 Lesson 3: Entity Classification (Check-the-Box)
**ID:** SEE2-001  
**Topic:** How LLCs are taxed and the "Check-the-Box" regulations.

### 🖼️ Visual Asset List
| Asset ID | Type | Description |

| `VIS_ENT_01` | **Flowchart** | "The Chameleon" - showing an LLC turning into a SP, Partnership, or Corp. |
| `VIS_ENT_02` | **Form** | Image of Form 8832 with the checkboxes highlighted. |
| `VIS_ENT_03` | **Table** | Default Classifications (Domestic vs Foreign). |

### 📊 Diagram Code (Mermaid)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[LLC Formed] --> B{How many owners?}
    B -- "One Owner" --> C[Disregarded Entity (Sch C)]
    B -- "Two+ Owners" --> D[Partnership (1065)]
    C -- "File 8832" --> E[C-Corporation]
    D -- "File 8832" --> E
    E -- "File 2553" --> F[S-Corporation]
```

### 🗣️ The Script

**(0:00-1:00) The Hook**  
**[Visual: VIS_ENT_01]**  
"What is an LLC? To the IRS... it doesn't exist.
Seriously. 'LLC' is a legal term, not a tax term. The IRS looks at an LLC and sees a ghost. It has to decide: Is this a person? A partnership? Or a corporation?
Today, we master the 'Check-the-Box' regulations, so you know exactly which form to file."

**(1:00-4:00) Defaults**  
**[Visual: VIS_ENT_03]**  
"If you do NOTHING (the Default), the IRS classifies you based on headcount.
**1 Owner:** You are a 'Disregarded Entity.' You are a Sole Proprietorship. You file Schedule C. The LLC is invisible.
**2+ Owners:** You are a Partnership. You file Form 1065.
Note: For married couples in common law states, you are a Partnership. In community property states, you *might* be two Sole Props. Watch out for that distinction."

**(4:00-7:00) The Election (Form 8832)**  
**[Visual: VIS_ENT_02]**  
"What if you don't like the default? You file Form 8832.
This form tells the IRS: 'I know I look like a Partnership, but I want you to tax me as a C-Corporation.'
Why would you do that? Maybe you want to retain earnings at the 21% corporate rate.
Once you elect C-Corp status, you can *then* file Form 2553 to become an S-Corp.
So the path is: LLC -> C-Corp (Election) -> S-Corp (Election)."

**(7:00-9:00) The 60-Month Rule**  
"Here is the Exam Trap. Once you elect to change your classification, you generally cannot change it again for **60 months** (5 years).
You are marrying this tax status. Make sure your client understands that.
Exception: If the ownership changes by more than 50%, the IRS may allow an early change."

**(9:00-10:00) Outro**  
"To summarize: Count the owners.
1 = Sch C.
2+ = Partnership.
Want to be a Corp? Check the box.
In the next video, we'll dive into the specific eligibility rules for that 'Holy Grail' of small business: the S-Corp."

## 🎬 Lesson 4: Section 1245 Recapture
**ID:** SEE2-012  
**Topic:** Character of gain on sale of business assets (Equipment). Depreciation Recapture.

### 🖼️ Visual Asset List
| Asset ID | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `VIS_1245_01` | **Animation** | A machine turning into cash. Part of the cash is blue (Ordinary), part is gold (Capital). |
| `VIS_1245_02` | **Formula** | "Lesser of: Accrued Depreciation OR Realized Gain". |
| `VIS_1245_03` | **Graph** | A bar chart showing Cost Basis, Adjusted Basis, and Sale Price. |

### 🗣️ The Script

**(0:00-1:00) The Hook**  
**[Visual: VIS_1245_01]**  
"You bought a machine for $10,000. You depreciated it down to zero. You sold it for $12,000.
You have a $12,000 gain. Great! Capital gains rates, right? 0%, 15%, maybe 20%?
Wrong.
The IRS says: 'Wait a minute. We gave you ordinary deductions for depreciation for years. We want that tax back at ordinary rates.'
This is **Section 1245 Depreciation Recapture**, and it turns gold (capital gains) into lead (ordinary income)."

**(1:00-4:00) The Rule**  
**[Visual: VIS_1245_02]**  
"The Rule of 1245 applies to 'Personal Property' (Machinery, Equipment, Furniture).
When you sell it, look at the gain.
The amount of the gain that represents the depreciation you previously took is **Ordinary Income**.
Any gain *above* the original purchase price is **Section 1231 Capital Gain**."

**(4:00-8:00) The Calculation**  
**[Visual: VIS_1245_03]**  
"Let's stick to our example.
**Cost:** $10,000
**Depreciation:** $10,000
**Adjusted Basis:** $0
**Sale Price:** $12,000
**Total Gain:** $12,000.

How much depreciation did we take? $10,000.
So, the first $10,000 of gain is **Recaptured as Ordinary Income** (taxed at your marginal rate, maybe 37%).
The remaining $2,000 (the appreciation above original cost) is **Section 1231 Gain** (taxed at lower capital gains rates).
Do not miss this. If you put $12,000 on the Capital Gains line, the IRS computer will flag it instantly."

**(8:00-10:00) Outro**  
"Recapture is the IRS's memory. They never forget a deduction they gave you.
Note: Real Estate (Buildings) works differently—that's Section 1250, which we will cover next.
But for now, remember: If it moves (machinery, vehicles), it's 1245, and the depreciation comes back as ordinary income."

## 🎬 Lesson 5: Passive Activity Losses (PAL)
**ID:** SEE2-015  
**Topic:** Rental real estate limitations and material participation.

### 🖼️ Visual Asset List
| Asset ID | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `VIS_PAL_01` | **Buckets** | Three buckets labeled "Active", "Portfolio", and "Passive". Water cannot flow from Passive to Active. |
| `VIS_PAL_02` | **Checklist** | The "Material Participation" tests (500 hours, Substantially All, etc.). |
| `VIS_PAL_03` | **Exception Badge** | "$25,000 Mom & Pop Exception". |

### 🗣️ The Script

**(0:00-1:00) The Hook**  
**[Visual: VIS_PAL_01]**  
"Doctors and Lawyers love buying rental condos to 'lower their taxes'.
It is your job to break their hearts.
Standard Passive Loss rules say: You cannot use a loss from a rental property to offset your wages from your job. Period.
Unless... you meet one of the exceptions we discuss today."

**(1:00-4:00) The 3 Buckets**  
"Income comes in three flavors:
1. **Active:** Wages, Salary, Commission.
2. **Portfolio:** Interest, Dividends, Stock sales.
3. **Passive:** Rental Real Estate (usually) and businesses where you don't work.
The Golden Rule: Passive Losses can *only* offset Passive Income. They are trapped in the passive bucket until you sell the activity."

**(4:00-7:00) Material Participation**  
**[Visual: VIS_PAL_02]**  
"How do we break out of the passive bucket? We prove 'Material Participation'.
There are 7 tests, but you only need to know the big ones:
1. **500 Hours:** Did you work 500 hours in the business?
2. **Substantially All:** Did you do basically *all* the work?
3. **100 Hours + Most:** Did you do 100 hours AND more than anyone else?
If you pass, the activity becomes 'Active' and losses are unlocked!"

**(7:00-9:00) The Real Estate Exception**  
**[Visual: VIS_PAL_03]**  
"What about that Doctor with the condo? He doesn't work 500 hours at the rental.
However, there is the **$25,000 Rental Real Estate Exception**.
If you 'Actively Participate' (make management decisions) AND your AGI is under $100,000...
You can deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against your wages.
This phases out between $100k and $150k. If AGI is $150k+, the exception is gone."

**(9:00-10:00) Outro**  
"So when your high-income client brings you a K-1 with a big rental loss, check their AGI first.
Then check their hours.
If they fail both, that loss is suspended.
This is Lesson 5. Go take the quiz on 'Suspended Losses' to see if you can calculate the carryforward correctly."
