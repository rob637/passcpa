Hey everyone, and welcome! Did you know that third-party audits are consistently a stumbling block for CISA candidates? <break time='1.0s' /> Many get tripped up on the nuances of cloud auditing and outsourcing, losing valuable points. Today, we're going to break down these critical areas, so you can confidently tackle those exam questions.

<break time='0.5s' />

Let's start with the basics. What are third-party audits? <break time='1.0s' /> Simply put, they're independent assessments of a vendor's controls. Now, the key terms you need to know are SOC 1, SOC 2, and SOC 3. SOC stands for System and Organization Controls. SOC 1 focuses on financial reporting controls. SOC 2 addresses security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. And SOC 3 is a summarized version of SOC 2, suitable for general public consumption.

Why does this matter to you, the auditor? <break time='1.0s' /> Well, more and more organizations are relying on third-party service providers, especially in the cloud. Think about it: your client might be using AWS, Azure, or some other SaaS provider for critical business functions. You, as the CISA, need to ensure that *those* providers have adequate controls in place to protect your client's data and systems. <break time='0.5s' /> If your client outsources their IT operations, you still have the responsibility to audit those operations. The audit responsibility doesn't magically disappear just because someone else is doing the work.

Real-world scenario: Imagine you're auditing a bank that uses a cloud-based CRM system. You need to verify that the CRM provider has robust security measures to protect customer data. This is where those SOC reports come in handy. <break time='1.0s' />

<break time='0.5s' />

Okay, let's talk about exam traps. ISACA loves to trick candidates on this topic. First, watch out for questions that ask about *solely* relying on a third-party audit report. <break time='1.0s' /> A SOC report is a great starting point, but it's not a substitute for your own due diligence. You still need to assess the report's scope, limitations, and relevance to your client's specific environment.

<break time='0.5s' />

Second, don't confuse SOC reports with certifications like ISO 27001. <break time='1.0s' /> They're different beasts. ISO 27001 is a standard for information security management systems, while SOC reports are audits of specific controls. A company can be ISO 27001 certified and *still* have control gaps that a SOC report would uncover.

Third, be wary of answers that suggest the *client* is responsible for performing the third-party audit on the *service provider*. The service provider commissions the audit, not the client. Your client *receives* and *reviews* the report. <break time='1.0s' />

<break time='0.5s' />

Fourth, the answer that LOOKS right but isn't often involves focusing on *contractual* obligations only. While contracts are important, you need to verify that the *controls are actually in place and operating effectively*, not just that they're written into a contract. <break time='1.0s' />

<break time='0.5s' />

Let's dive into a specific scenario. Let's say you're auditing a company that outsources its data backup and recovery to a third-party provider. <break time='1.0s' />

First, you'd obtain and review the provider's SOC 2 report, focusing on the security and availability sections.

<break time='0.5s' />

Second, you'd assess the report's scope and determine if it covers all the services that your client is using. <break time='1.0s' /> Is it a Type I or Type II report? Type II is better because it tests the operating effectiveness of controls over a period of time.

<break time='0.5s' />

Third, you'd review your client's contract with the provider to ensure that it includes clauses related to data security, incident response, and business continuity.

<break time='0.5s' />

Fourth, you'd perform independent testing to verify that the backups are being performed regularly and that they can be successfully restored. This might involve testing a sample of backups to ensure their integrity. <break time='1.0s' />

<break time='0.5s' />

Finally, you'd assess your client's monitoring and oversight of the third-party provider. <break time='1.0s' /> Are they regularly reviewing the provider's performance and addressing any identified issues?

<break time='0.5s' />

Okay, let's talk about memory techniques. To remember the importance of verifying controls, not just relying on reports, think of the acronym **VERIFY**:

*   **V**endor reports are a *starting point*.
*   **E**valuate the report's scope and limitations.
*   **R**eview the client's contract.
*   **I**ndependently test controls.
*   **F**ocus on operating effectiveness.
*   **Y**ou are still responsible.

<break time='1.0s' />

Think of it like this: you wouldn't blindly trust a weather forecast without looking out the window yourself, right? <break time='1.0s' /> Similarly, you can't blindly trust a SOC report without verifying the controls in practice.

<break time='0.5s' />

Alright, let's recap the key takeaways. If you remember nothing else, remember these three things:

1.  Third-party audits are essential for assessing the controls of service providers, especially in cloud environments. <break time='1.0s' />
2.  Don't solely rely on SOC reports. Perform your own due diligence and independent testing. <break time='1.0s' />
3.  The audit responsibility remains with you, the CISA, even when IT operations are outsourced. <break time='1.0s' />

<break time='0.5s' />

You've got this! By understanding these concepts and avoiding the exam traps, you'll be well on your way to mastering third-party audits on the CISA exam. Good luck!
