Hey everyone, welcome! Did you know that physical security lapses are a surprisingly common reason why companies fail their IT audits? ... I'm talking everything from unlocked server rooms to inadequate visitor logs. ... And that oversight can cost you points on the CISA exam, too. In this video, we're tackling physical security audits, a crucial part of the Information Systems Auditing Process. Let’s dive in!

...

Okay, so what is a physical security audit? ... Simply put, it's a review of the physical controls in place to protect an organization's assets – its data, equipment, and personnel. We're talking about things like access controls, surveillance systems, environmental controls, and even disaster recovery planning. Key terms here are deterrence, detection, and response. ... Deterrence aims to prevent incidents from happening in the first place – think security cameras and fences. Detection is about identifying when something has happened – like an alarm system going off. And response is the action taken to mitigate the damage – for example, a fire suppression system activating.

...

Why does this matter to you, the auditor? Well, think about it. All the fancy encryption and intrusion detection systems in the world are useless if someone can just walk into the server room and unplug everything. ... Physical security is the foundation upon which all other security controls are built. As auditors, it's our job to assess the effectiveness of these controls and identify any weaknesses that could be exploited.

...

Imagine a real-world scenario: you're auditing a bank. You review their cybersecurity protocols and find them top-notch. But then you discover that the server room's door is often left unlocked, and the backup tapes are stored in an unsecured closet. ... Suddenly, that impressive cybersecurity posture looks a lot less impressive, doesn't it? The physical vulnerabilities expose the entire system. That’s why it’s critical to understand this area.

...

Now, let's talk about some exam traps. ISACA loves to trick you on this topic. Watch out for questions that focus solely on technical controls, like firewalls and intrusion detection systems, while completely ignoring the physical environment. They want to see if you recognize that physical security is a prerequisite for effective technical security. ...

...

Don't confuse physical access controls with logical access controls. Physical access controls are things like key cards, biometric scanners, and security guards. Logical access controls are things like passwords, user accounts, and permissions. They are related, but distinct. A question might describe a robust logical access control system but then hint at weak physical security. The answer will likely involve strengthening the physical security, not just tweaking the logical access.

...

Another common trick is to present an answer that sounds right but isn't the best answer. For example, a question might ask about the best way to protect a server room. One answer might be "install a strong lock on the door." That's okay, but a better answer might be "implement a multi-factor authentication system that includes biometric scanning and video surveillance." ... The key is to look for the most comprehensive and layered security approach.

...

Finally, be wary of questions that focus on the cost of physical security measures. While cost is a factor, the primary focus should always be on effectiveness and risk mitigation. ISACA wants to see that you prioritize security over saving a few dollars. A question might present a cheap solution and a more expensive, but more effective, solution. The right answer will almost always be the more effective solution, assuming it’s reasonably justified.

...

Let's walk through a scenario. Let's say you're auditing a data center. Your first step is to review the physical security policies and procedures. ... Are they documented? Are they regularly updated? Are employees trained on them?

...

Next, you'll want to conduct a physical walkthrough of the facility. Check the perimeter for vulnerabilities. Are there gaps in the fence? Are the security cameras properly positioned and functioning? ... Inspect the access control systems. Are visitors required to sign in and wear badges? Are access logs regularly reviewed?

...

Then, examine the environmental controls. Is the temperature and humidity properly regulated? Is there a fire suppression system in place? Is there a backup power generator? ... Finally, review the disaster recovery plan. Does it address physical security threats, such as flooding or earthquakes? Is the plan regularly tested and updated? By systematically examining each of these areas, you can get a comprehensive understanding of the data center's physical security posture.

...

Okay, let’s make this stick. How can we remember all this? Think "PEDALS" – P- Perimeter, E- Environmental, D- Disaster Recovery, A- Access Controls, L- Logs, S- Surveillance. PEDALS. ... When you see a question about physical security, run through the PEDALS checklist in your head. It'll help you identify the key areas to consider and avoid those common exam traps. Think of it like checking the tires on your car before a long trip. It’s basic, but essential for a safe journey.

...

So, if you remember nothing else from this video, remember these three things: First, physical security is the foundation of all other security controls. Second, ISACA will try to trick you by focusing solely on technical controls or by presenting answers that sound good but aren't the best option. And third, PEDALS – Perimeter, Environmental, Disaster Recovery, Access Controls, Logs, and Surveillance – use that checklist to stay on track. ... You've got this! Now go out there and ace that CISA exam!
