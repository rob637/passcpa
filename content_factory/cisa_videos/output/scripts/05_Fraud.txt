Fraud response...knowing this could be the difference between passing and failing the CISA exam.

Fraud response, in the context of an IS audit, is the process an IS auditor undertakes when they suspect or detect fraudulent activity. It's more than just identifying the problem; it's about understanding the established procedures, gathering evidence, and knowing when and how to escalate… It's critical because an IS auditor has a responsibility to protect the organization's assets and reputation. Failure to respond appropriately to fraud can lead to significant financial losses, legal repercussions, and reputational damage. Think of it as a detective novel...you need to follow the clues but also follow protocol.

The number one trap ISACA sets is this: they present multiple options that sound like good ideas…like immediately notifying law enforcement or confronting the suspected fraudster. The trap is assuming you have the authority or expertise to take those actions independently, before following proper procedures. The correct answer is almost always the option that emphasizes following established organizational policies and procedures or alerting the appropriate internal stakeholders, like the audit committee or legal counsel. Never jump the gun…always follow protocol first.

For example, when auditing access controls to a financial system, you discover an account with excessive privileges that has been used to make unauthorized transfers. Instead of immediately blocking the account, your first action should be to notify your audit manager or the designated contact person within the organization, as per the organization's fraud response plan. This ensures a coordinated and compliant investigation, protects the integrity of the evidence, and avoids potential legal issues. You're there to identify…not prosecute.

The key takeaway? Always prioritize following established fraud response policies and escalating concerns to the appropriate internal channels. Remember that, and you'll be well on your way to acing the CISA exam! You've got this!
