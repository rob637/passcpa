Hey everyone, and welcome! Did you know that fraud-related questions are a major stumbling block on the CISA exam? <break time='1.0s' /> It’s not just about identifying fraud, it's about *what you do* when you find it. Mess this up, and you’re not just losing points on the exam, you're potentially failing to protect the organization you're auditing. <break time='0.5s' /> Today, we're tackling the critical first steps in fraud response.

Okay, let's build a strong foundation here. <break time='0.5s' /> What exactly is fraud in the context of information systems auditing? Simply put, it's any intentional act designed to deceive or misappropriate assets, involving information systems. This could be anything from unauthorized access to data manipulation to outright theft using technology. <break time='1.0s' /> Key terms to remember are: fraud risk, fraud prevention, fraud detection, and fraud response. We're focusing on that last one: *response*.

Why does this matter for IS auditors? Well, you are the gatekeepers of information integrity and security. You're not just checking boxes; you're safeguarding the organization's assets and reputation. <break time='0.5s' /> Think about a real-world scenario: you're auditing a financial institution and discover anomalies in transaction logs suggesting potential embezzlement. <break time='1.0s' /> Your response is crucial. A misstep could jeopardize the investigation, alert the perpetrators, and cause irreparable damage. The CISA exam tests your ability to navigate these situations ethically and effectively.

Now, let’s talk about the exam traps. ISACA loves to test your understanding of the *correct* sequence of actions. <break time='0.5s' />

First, watch out for questions that emphasize immediate *investigation* as the first step. While investigation is important, it's NOT your initial action. <break time='1.0s' /> Remember, you're an auditor, not a detective. Your primary role is to report, not investigate.

Second, don't confuse *reporting* with *confronting*. The correct answer will almost never involve directly confronting the suspected perpetrator. That's the role of management and law enforcement. <break time='1.0s' /> Confrontation can compromise the investigation and potentially put you at risk.

Third, the answer that *looks* right but isn't, often involves "immediately notifying senior management." While notifying management is essential, it's not the *very first* thing you do. <break time='0.5s' /> There's a crucial step *before* notification.

Fourth, be wary of answers that suggest immediately implementing new controls. While strengthening controls is a good long-term strategy, it’s not the immediate response to *discovering* fraud. <break time='1.0s' /> Your first action should be more cautious and focused on ensuring the integrity of the evidence.

Let's dive into a specific example. <break time='0.5s' /> Let's say you're auditing a retail company's e-commerce platform and you find evidence of suspicious transactions originating from a single IP address, repeatedly purchasing high-value items with different stolen credit cards. <break time='1.0s' /> The transactions are being shipped to a single drop address. What's your first move?

Here's the step-by-step approach, according to CISA best practices:

1. **Acknowledge:** Recognize that you have potentially uncovered a fraudulent activity. Don't ignore it, hoping it will disappear.

2. **Document:** *Carefully* document all the evidence you've found: the IP address, the transaction logs, the shipping address, and any other relevant data. <break time='0.5s' /> Ensure the documentation is secure and tamper-proof. This is critical for any future investigation.

3. **Notify:** *Immediately* notify the appropriate authority. Who is this? The *audit committee or a designated senior manager*. This is the key. <break time='1.0s' /> They are responsible for initiating a formal investigation. *This is usually the correct answer*.

4. **Secure:** Secure the evidence and the system. While you aren't investigating, you need to ensure that the evidence isn't tampered with and that the fraudulent activity is contained as much as possible without alerting the perpetrator.

Now, how can we remember this under exam pressure? <break time='0.5s' /> Think of the acronym **DAN-S**: **D**ocument, **A**cknowledge, **N**otify, **S**ecure. DAN-S is your fraud response dance! <break time='1.0s' /> Visualize yourself doing a little jig, remembering each step. It’s silly, but it works! Or, think of it like a doctor: you diagnose (acknowledge), record (document), refer (notify), and stabilize (secure).

Okay, let's wrap this up. <break time='0.5s' /> If you remember nothing else, remember these three things:

1. **Document, Document, Document:** Impeccable documentation is paramount.
2. **Notify the Audit Committee or Designated Senior Manager:** This is your primary responsibility as an IS auditor in this situation.
3. **DAN-S:** Use the memory technique to recall the correct sequence.

You've got this! <break time='0.5s' /> Understanding the correct fraud response is crucial, not only for passing the CISA exam but also for protecting your organization in the real world. Now go out there and ace that exam!
