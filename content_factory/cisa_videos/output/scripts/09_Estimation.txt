Hey everyone, and welcome! <break time='0.5s' /> I'm here to help you conquer the CISA exam. Did you know that a significant number of people fail the Information Systems Auditing Process domain? <break time='1.0s' /> It's often because they stumble on seemingly small details, like understanding function points. Imagine missing out on a certification because you didn't fully grasp one concept. Today, we're going to make sure that doesn't happen to you. We'll be diving deep into function point analysis. <break time='0.5s' />

Okay, so what *are* function points? <break time='0.5s' /> Simply put, function point analysis, or FPA, is a standardized method for measuring the size of software applications. <break time='0.5s' /> We're talking about quantifying the functionality that a system provides to its users. <break time='0.5s' /> Key terms here are *functionality*, meaning what the software *does*, and *measurement*. <break time='0.5s' /> Think of it as counting the features from the user’s perspective.

Why does this matter for auditors? <break time='0.5s' /> Well, as IS auditors, we need to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of IT projects. <break time='0.5s' /> Function points help us do that. <break time='0.5s' /> They provide a consistent way to estimate development effort, track project progress, and compare the productivity of different development teams. <break time='0.5s' /> Think about this: you're auditing a project that's significantly over budget and behind schedule. <break time='0.5s' /> Understanding function points allows you to analyze whether the original scope was accurately estimated, or if scope creep is the real culprit. <break time='0.5s' /> You can also use it to compare the project's productivity against industry benchmarks. <break time='0.5s' /> Without a solid understanding of function points, you're essentially flying blind, making it difficult to provide meaningful recommendations. <break time='0.5s' />

Now, let's talk about exam traps. <break time='0.5s' /> ISACA loves to trick you with these! <break time='0.5s' />

First, watch out for questions that focus on *lines of code* as a measure of software size. <break time='0.5s' /> Function points are based on *functionality*, not the number of code lines. <break time='0.5s' /> Lines of code are language-dependent and don't accurately reflect the complexity or value delivered to the user. <break time='0.5s' /> Function points are language-independent.

Second, don't confuse function points with *technical complexity factors*. <break time='0.5s' /> While technical complexity *does* influence the effort required to develop software, it's a separate consideration. <break time='0.5s' /> Function points primarily measure the user-facing functionality. <break time='0.5s' /> Technical complexity factors are applied *after* the unadjusted function point count is determined. <break time='0.5s' />

Third, the answer that *looks* right, but isn't. <break time='0.5s' /> ISACA might offer an answer that correctly *defines* function points but fails to address what it's *used for* in an audit context. <break time='0.5s' /> Always choose the answer that demonstrates the *practical application* of function points in information systems auditing. <break time='0.5s' /> For example, an answer choice might say "Function points measure software size" which is true, but a better answer would be "Function points help auditors assess project efficiency and scope management."

Finally, be wary of questions that mix up the different *types* of function points. <break time='0.5s' /> While we're focusing on the basic concept, be aware that there are different methodologies, like IFPUG (International Function Point Users Group), which is a common standard. <break time='0.5s' /> Questions may try to throw you off by referencing less common or outdated methods. <break time='0.5s' /> Stick with the widely accepted standards like IFPUG in your thinking.

Let's dive into some examples. <break time='0.5s' />

Let's say you're auditing a company that's developing a new online banking application. <break time='0.5s' /> To use function points, you would first identify the key user functions: inputs, outputs, inquiries, logical internal files, and external interface files. <break time='0.5s' />

For example, a user input might be a "transfer funds" screen. <break time='0.5s' /> An output could be an account statement. <break time='0.5s' /> An inquiry might be a balance check. <break time='0.5s' />

Next, you'd classify each of these functions based on their complexity: simple, average, or complex. <break time='0.5s' /> This classification is based on factors like the number of data elements and file references involved. <break time='0.5s' />

Then, you assign a weight to each function based on its type and complexity. <break time='0.5s' /> These weights are defined in the IFPUG methodology. <break time='0.5s' />

Finally, you calculate the unadjusted function point count by summing the weighted values of all the functions. <break time='0.5s' /> This gives you a baseline measure of the application's size. <break time='0.5s' /> Remember, this is the *unadjusted* function point count! You then apply technical complexity factors to arrive at the adjusted function point count.

Okay, one more example. <break time='0.5s' /> You are auditing a system upgrade. The project manager states that the upgrade added 5000 lines of code. How can you use function points to evaluate this project? First, you would identify the *new* user functionality added by the upgrade, not just the lines of code changed. <break time='0.5s' /> Then, you would determine the function point count associated with that new functionality. <break time='0.5s' /> Finally, you can compare the cost per function point for the upgrade to industry averages or previous projects to assess the upgrade's cost-effectiveness.

Let's make this stick. <break time='0.5s' /> Let's use a mnemonic: **F**unctional **U**nderstanding **N**ecessitates **C**areful **T**hinking **P**ertaining **T**o **S**ize. <break time='0.5s' /> **FUNCT PTS**. Think of it as "Fun Cats Points," but with a "T" in there. <break time='0.5s' /> Whatever helps you remember! <break time='0.5s' /> Visually, imagine a set of building blocks, each representing a function. <break time='0.5s' /> The more blocks, the bigger the application, and the more function points it has. <break time='0.5s' /> Think of it like counting the individual Lego bricks in a massive Lego castle.

If you remember nothing else: <break time='0.5s' />

1. Function points measure *functionality*, not lines of code. <break time='0.5s' />
2. They're essential for auditors to assess project efficiency and scope. <break time='0.5s' />
3. Be aware of the common exam traps related to technical complexity and different methodologies. <break time='1.0s' />

You've got this! By mastering concepts like function points, you're well on your way to CISA success. <break time='0.5s' /> Keep studying, and I'll see you in the next video!
