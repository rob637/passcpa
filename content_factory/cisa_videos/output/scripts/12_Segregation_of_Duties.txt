Segregation of Duties... it's not just good practice; it's a CISA exam staple, and knowing it can be the difference between passing and failing.

Segregation of Duties, or SoD, is the principle of assigning different people the separate tasks of authorizing transactions, recording transactions, and maintaining custody of assets. ... Auditors care because inadequate SoD creates opportunities for fraud and errors to go undetected. ... It's a cornerstone of internal controls, and you'll see it everywhere in the audit process.

Now, here's the exam trap. ISACA loves to trick you with questions that offer seemingly reasonable, but ultimately insufficient, role separations. ... The trap is thinking that ANY separation automatically equals good SoD. ... The correct answer is the separation that prevents a SINGLE individual from controlling ALL phases of a transaction. ... For example, separating the system administrator from having access to create or approve payments. ... You need to understand the *impact* of the separation, not just the fact that roles are separated.

For example, when auditing a payroll system, don't just look for separate payroll processors and approvers. ... Dig deeper. ... Does the approver also have the ability to modify employee records? ... If so, the SoD is weak, even with separate individuals involved. ... They could create a fictitious employee, process their own fraudulent payments, and then approve them.

The key takeaway? Segregation of Duties is about preventing ANY single person from having too much control over a critical process. ... Master this concept, and you'll be well on your way to CISA success.
