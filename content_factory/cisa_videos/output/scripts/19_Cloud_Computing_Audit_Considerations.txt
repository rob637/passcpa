Cloud auditing… can be a nightmare on the CISA exam. But nail this, and you’ll be golden.

So, what *is* cloud computing? It’s on-demand access to computing resources – servers, storage, databases – over the internet. Think of it like renting, instead of buying, your IT infrastructure. As an auditor, you care because traditional, on-premise security controls often *don't* translate directly to the cloud. You need to understand who’s responsible for *what*.

That brings us to the shared responsibility model. It's critical. The cloud provider handles the security *of* the cloud, like the physical infrastructure. You, the customer, are responsible for security *in* the cloud. This includes your data, applications, identity management, and operating systems, depending on the cloud service model.

Now, here’s the ISACA trap. They love to blur the lines between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. For example, a common question asks: "In IaaS, the customer is responsible for…" The trap answer is often something vague like "overall security." The *correct* answer is more specific: "managing the operating system." IaaS gives you the *most* control, so you're responsible for more. Remember: IaaS = You manage the OS. PaaS = you manage the applications. SaaS = the provider manages almost everything.

Cloud audit challenges also come up frequently. They'll ask about things like data residency, vendor lock-in, and regulatory compliance. The trick is to remember the cloud provider may be located in a different jurisdiction with different laws. The trap is focusing only on *your* organization's compliance requirements.

For example, when auditing a SaaS application like Salesforce, you need to verify *their* security certifications, like SOC 2, and confirm that their data privacy policies align with regulations like GDPR if you’re processing EU citizen data. You also need to audit your *own* configuration of Salesforce.

The one thing you *must* remember? Shared responsibility. Understand *who* is responsible for *what* in each cloud model. Nail that, and you’re one step closer to passing the CISA exam. You got this!
