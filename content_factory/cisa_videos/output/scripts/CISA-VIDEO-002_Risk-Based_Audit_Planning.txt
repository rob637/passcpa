Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel! Are you prepping for the CISA exam? <break time='1.0s' /> Let’s talk about a topic that trips up a lot of people: Risk-Based Audit Planning.

I see so many people fail because they don’t truly understand how fundamental this concept is. <break time='1.0s' /> You can know all the controls in the world, but if you're not auditing the *right* things, you’re wasting your time.

So, what *is* Risk-Based Audit Planning? Simply put, it's prioritizing your audit efforts based on the areas that pose the greatest risk to the organization. <break time='1.0s' /> It’s about focusing your limited resources where they'll have the biggest impact. You identify, assess, and prioritize risks to determine the scope, nature, and timing of your audit.

Now, let’s talk about some common exam traps. ISACA *loves* to throw these at you:

First, they'll try to get you to choose the *easiest* audit, not the *most important* one. Remember, efficiency is good, but effectiveness is paramount. <break time='1.0s' /> Choose the option that addresses the highest-impact risk, even if it's more complex.

Second, be wary of answers that focus solely on compliance. Compliance is important, but it's not the *only* driver of risk. <break time='1.0s' /> Look for answers that consider operational, financial, and strategic risks as well. A risk-based approach looks at the *whole* picture.

Third, they might present a scenario where management has already decided the audit scope. Your job as an auditor is to independently assess risk and challenge management's decisions if necessary. <break time='1.0s' /> Don't blindly accept their pre-defined scope if it doesn't align with your risk assessment.

Okay, let’s use a mnemonic to help you remember the key steps: **I-A-P-S**.

*   **I**dentify risks
*   **A**ssess risks (likelihood and impact)
*   **P**rioritize risks
*   **S**cope the audit based on prioritized risks

Think of it as "I Assess, Prioritize, Scope!"

So, the key takeaway here is this: Risk-Based Audit Planning is all about focusing on the *most important* areas. Don't get distracted by easy audits, compliance-only approaches, or management's pre-defined scope. <break time='1.0s' /> Remember **I-A-P-S** and you'll be well on your way to acing those risk-based questions on the CISA exam. Good luck, and I’ll see you in the next video!
