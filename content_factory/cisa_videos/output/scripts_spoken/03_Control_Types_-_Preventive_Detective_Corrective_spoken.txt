Hey future CISAs... failing to grasp control types is a surefire way to lose points on the exam. Let's nail it down.

Control types... are actions taken to mitigate risk. Simple. But auditors need to classify them to assess their effectiveness and design. We look at whether a control prevents, detects, or corrects errors and incidents. It's about understanding how controls fit into the overall security posture... and identifying gaps.

Now, here's the eye-SAH-kah trap. They love to blur the lines between detective and corrective controls. The trap is... they'll give you a scenario where something is identified and fixed, but the question focuses on identification only. The correct answer is the detective control... even if corrective action follows. Remember, detective controls only discover problems... corrective controls fix them. Preventative controls... stop problems before they even happen.

For example, when auditing access controls... you see a log monitoring system flagging unusual login attempts. That's detective. The system automatically disabling the account? That’s corrective. Requiring multi-factor authentication in the first place? That's preventative.

The ONE thing to remember? Focus on the primary function of the control. Is it stopping, finding, or fixing? Master this... and you'll be ready to ACE those control type questions!
