Every IS audit follows the same fundamental lifecycle. Master this, and you'll have a framework for answering any audit procedural question on the exam. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase one: Audit Planning. This is where most audits succeed or fail. You start by understanding the audit subject. What system? What process? What's the scope? Then you conduct a preliminary risk assessment. Where are the high-risk areas that deserve more testing? You develop your audit program, which is your detailed roadmap of what you'll test and how. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's an exam trap: the audit program should be flexible, not rigid. Conditions change during fieldwork. A good auditor adapts. <break time='1s'/> Phase two: Fieldwork and Evidence Gathering. Now you're in the field, executing your audit program. You're interviewing personnel, observing processes, reviewing documentation, and running technical tests. Everything gets documented in your workpapers. <break time='0.5s'/> Key point for the exam: documentation must be sufficient for another qualified auditor to understand what you did and why. If it's not in the workpapers, it didn't happen. <break time='1s'/> Phase three: Analysis and Evaluation. You've gathered your evidence. Now you evaluate what it means. Are controls designed properly? Are they operating effectively? Where are the gaps? This is where you identify findings and assess their significance. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase four: Reporting. You document your findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Before the final report, you hold an exit conference with management. This is critical: it's where management can correct factual errors and provide responses to findings. No surprises in the final report. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase five: Follow-Up. The audit isn't truly complete until you verify that management has addressed the findings. This might be a separate follow-up audit or part of the next regular audit cycle. <break time='0.5s'/> On the exam, remember: auditors provide assurance and make recommendations. We don't implement controls ourselves. That would compromise our independence.
