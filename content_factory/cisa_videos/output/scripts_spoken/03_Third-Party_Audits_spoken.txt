Hey SEE-suh candidates… Cloud audits and outsourcing… get these wrong, and you risk failing. So let’s nail it.

What are third-party audits? Simply put, they’re independent assessments of a service provider's controls… Think sock 2, ISO 27001, or CSA STAR certifications. As auditors, we care because these audits provide assurance…assurance that our organization's risks are being managed effectively by its vendors. Without them, we’re relying on blind faith.

Now, here’s the exam trap. eye-SAH-kah loves to ask which control is MOST important to verify when auditing an organization that uses cloud services. The trap is… selecting generic controls like "access controls" or "security awareness training." While important, they're not specific enough. The correct answer is almost always a control related to vendor management or contractual obligations. Think about it… the organization is relying on the vendor… so the contract is king!

For example, when auditing a company using a cloud-based CRM, don’t just check if user accounts have strong passwords. Instead, focus on whether the contract with the CRM provider clearly defines data security responsibilities, incident response procedures, and audit rights. Is there a right-to-audit clause? That's your key.

And another common question… When an organization outsources I-T operations, who is responsible for auditing those operations? The trap here is thinking responsibility shifts entirely to the vendor. The correct answer is… the organization retains ultimate audit responsibility! Outsourcing doesn't eliminate accountability; it just distributes it.

The one thing to remember: Third-party audits are assurance tools, but your audit responsibility never disappears. Get this right, and you're one step closer to passing the SEE-suh!
