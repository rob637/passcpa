Welcome to Domain 2: Governance and Management of IT. Let's dive into IT governance frameworks. <break time='0.8s'/> This domain represents sixteen percent of your exam, roughly twenty-four questions. And let me tell you, this is where many candidates struggle. Not because the concepts are hard, but because they blur together. Governance, management, COBIT, ITIL, ISO. It can feel like alphabet soup. <break time='0.5s'/> Let's bring clarity. <break time='1s'/> The central question of Domain 2 is this: Is IT being directed, controlled, and measured in a way that supports the organization's objectives? <break time='0.8s'/> Here's the map. Domain 2 covers four major areas. <break time='0.5s'/> First: IT Governance versus IT Management. These are not the same thing. Governance is about direction and oversight. It's what the board and executives do. Management is about execution. It's what IT leadership does day to day. The exam loves this distinction. <break time='0.8s'/> Second: Frameworks. COBIT for governance, ITIL for service management, ISO 27001 for security, COSO for enterprise risk. You don't need to memorize every detail, but you need to know what each framework does and when to use it. <break time='0.8s'/> Third: Strategy and Planning. How does IT strategy align with business strategy? What's the IT strategic plan? What about the portfolio of IT investments? <break time='0.8s'/> Fourth: Risk and Resource Management. How does the organization identify, assess, and respond to IT risks? How does it manage IT resources: people, money, vendors? <break time='1s'/> Here's why this domain matters for auditors. When you audit any IT area, you're ultimately asking whether governance and management provided appropriate direction and oversight. Weak governance is the root cause of many IT failures. <break time='0.5s'/> As we go through this domain, pay attention to roles and responsibilities. Who owns what? The board provides oversight. Management provides direction. IT implements. When these boundaries blur, problems occur. <break time='0.8s'/> Let's dig into the frameworks and build your governance foundation.
