COBIT is the most frequently tested framework on the CISA exam. Let's make sure you understand it inside and out. <break time='0.8s'/> COBIT stands for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology. It was created by ISACA, the same organization that certifies CISAs. It provides a comprehensive framework for IT governance and management. <break time='0.5s'/> The current version is COBIT 2019, though the exam tests concepts rather than version-specific details. <break time='1s'/> Let's start with the core components. <break time='0.8s'/> First: Governance Objectives. COBIT identifies five governance objectives: Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor, often called E.D.M.. Governance ensures that stakeholder needs are evaluated, direction is set, and performance is monitored. <break time='0.5s'/> Second: Management Objectives. COBIT groups management into four domains. A.P.O. means Align, Plan, and Organize. This includes strategy, enterprise architecture, and portfolio management. B.A.I. means Build, Acquire, and Implement. This covers programs, projects, and change management. D.S.S. means Deliver, Service, and Support. This is operations and service delivery. M.E.A. means Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess. This is performance monitoring and compliance. <break time='0.8s'/> Memory trick for the domains: A.P.O. B.A.I. D.S.S. M.E.A.. Or think: A People Business Does Some Special Meaningful Effort Always. <break time='1s'/> Now, how do you audit using COBIT? You assess whether the organization has defined processes, whether those processes are being followed, and whether they're achieving the intended outcomes. COBIT provides maturity models to help you rate process capability from incomplete to optimized. <break time='0.8s'/> Common exam scenarios: The question describes an IT problem. Your job is to identify which COBIT domain or process is most relevant. Strategy problem? A.P.O.. Implementation problem? B.A.I.. Operations problem? D.S.S.. Monitoring problem? M.E.A.. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's an auditor's perspective: COBIT gives you a common language to discuss IT governance with management. Instead of saying 'your change process is broken,' you can reference COBIT BAI06 and point to specific control objectives that aren't being met. <break time='0.8s'/> Remember: COBIT is about governance. It helps you answer the question: Is IT being directed and controlled properly?
