Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel! You know, the SEE-sah exam can be brutal. ... A lot of people struggle, and often it's not because they don't know the material, but because they get tripped up on the exam's specific way of testing knowledge. Today, we’re tackling a tricky area: Cloud Auditing, specifically the Cloud Approach within the Information Systems Auditing Process domain. We're going to break down the core concepts, highlight the common exam traps, and give you some techniques to remember it all. Let's get started!

...

So, what exactly is the Cloud Approach to auditing? ... At its core, it's about understanding the unique challenges and opportunities presented by auditing environments hosted in the cloud. We're talking about services like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud – platforms where your organization's data and applications reside on someone else's infrastructure.

Key terms here are important. First, Cloud Service Provider (CSP). That's your AWS, Azure, Google. They provide the infrastructure, platform, or software. Then, there's Shared Responsibility Model. This is critical. It defines who is responsible for what security controls. The CSP handles security of the cloud, while you, the customer, are responsible for security in the cloud. Finally, understand Cloud Service Models: IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service). Each model shifts the responsibility differently.

Why does this matter for auditors? Because traditional auditing methods often fall short in the cloud. ... You don't have direct physical access to the servers. You're relying on the CSP's controls and reports. This means you need to focus on evaluating the CSP's security practices, understanding the shared responsibility model, and verifying your own organization's controls within the cloud environment.

Think about it: You're auditing a company that uses AWS for its customer database. You can't just walk into an AWS data center and inspect the servers. ... Instead, you need to review AWS's sock 2 reports, examine your company's IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies within AWS, and verify that data encryption is properly configured both in transit and at rest. That's the cloud approach in action.

...

Now, let's talk about the exam traps. This is where eye-SAH-kah loves to trick you!

First, watch out for questions that assume you have full control over the cloud environment. ... They might ask about implementing a specific security control, but the answer choices could be unrealistic given the shared responsibility model. Remember, you're limited by what the CSP allows and what your organization has configured.

Second, don't confuse assurance with attestation. A sock 2 report from the CSP provides assurance about their controls. But you need to perform your own attestation activities to verify that your organization is using those controls effectively and securely within your cloud setup. The CSP's sock 2 isn't a free pass; you still have work to do. ...

Third, the answer that looks right but isn't often involves overly technical solutions that aren't practical for auditors. The exam is testing your audit skills, not your cloud engineering skills. So, focus on answers that emphasize governance, risk management, compliance, and monitoring, rather than diving into specific code configurations.

Finally, be wary of questions that ignore the different cloud service models. ... A control that's appropriate for IaaS might be completely irrelevant for SaaS. Always consider the specific service model mentioned in the question. For example, if a company is using Salesforce (SaaS), you're not going to be auditing the underlying operating system. You'll be focusing on user access controls, data security policies within Salesforce, and integration security.

...

Let's dive into a couple of specific scenarios to illustrate this.

Scenario 1: You're auditing a bank that uses Azure to host its online banking application (PaaS). One question asks about ensuring the security of the database. The answer choices include: A) Implementing a firewall on the Azure virtual machine, B) Reviewing the Azure sequel Database security settings, C) Physically inspecting the server in the Azure data center, D) Requiring all developers to complete Azure security training.

The trap here is option A and C. Option A assumes you have direct control over the underlying infrastructure, which you don't in PaaS. Option C is simply impossible. ... The best answer is B and D. Reviewing the Azure sequel Database security settings aligns with your responsibility in the shared responsibility model, and training the developers who build the application is always a good idea.

Scenario 2: You're auditing a healthcare provider that uses a SaaS-based electronic health record (EHR) system. The question asks about ensuring compliance with HIP-ah. The answer choices include: A) Reviewing the EHR vendor's HIP-ah compliance certification, B) Implementing encryption on the EHR vendor's servers, C) Conducting penetration testing on the EHR vendor's application, D) Ensuring that all patient data is stored in a data center located within the United States.

Here, options B and C are incorrect because you don't have the authority to implement encryption on the vendor's servers or conduct penetration testing on their application. Option D might sound right, but HIP-ah doesn't mandate data residency. ... The best answer is A. Reviewing the vendor's HIP-ah compliance certification provides assurance that they have implemented the necessary controls to protect patient data. You would also want to review your own policies and procedures for using the EHR system to ensure your compliance with HIP-ah.

...

Okay, let's talk about memory techniques. This stuff can be a lot to remember! I use the acronym "SHARE" to help me recall the key aspects of cloud auditing:

   Shared Responsibility: Understand who's responsible for what.
   Hosting Model: Know the IaaS, PaaS, SaaS differences.
   Assurance vs. Attestation: The CSP's report isn't enough.
   Risk Management: Focus on cloud-specific risks.
   Environment: Cloud environment and CSP specific controls.

Think of it like a house: You share the responsibility for maintaining it with your landlord. They handle the roof and foundation, but you're responsible for keeping your apartment clean and secure. The SEE-sah exam wants to make sure you understand how that sharing works in the cloud.

...

Alright, let's wrap it up. If you remember nothing else from this video, remember these three things:

1.  The Shared Responsibility Model is paramount. Know who's responsible for what. ...
2.  Don't assume you have full control in the cloud. Your actions are limited by the CSP and the service model.
3.  Focus on audit principles: Governance, risk management, compliance, and monitoring. Don't get bogged down in technical details.

You've got this! ... Understanding the Cloud Approach is crucial for passing the SEE-sah exam. Keep practicing, keep studying, and I'll see you in the next video. Good luck!
