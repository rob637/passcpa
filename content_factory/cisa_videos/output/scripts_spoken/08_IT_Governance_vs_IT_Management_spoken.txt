This is one of the most tested distinctions on the CISA exam. IT Governance versus IT Management. Let's make sure you never confuse them. <break time='1s'/> IT Governance asks: Are we doing the right things? IT Management asks: Are we doing things right? <break time='0.8s'/> Governance is about direction, oversight, and accountability. It's performed by the board of directors and executive management. They set strategic direction. They approve major investments. They ensure IT supports business objectives. <break time='0.5s'/> Management is about execution, implementation, and day-to-day operations. It's performed by IT leadership: the CIO, IT directors, managers. They implement the strategy. They run the operations. They deliver services. <break time='1s'/> Here's a simple test. If someone is setting policy, that's governance. If someone is implementing policy, that's management. If someone is providing oversight, that's governance. If someone is doing the work, that's management. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam trap: The question might describe a scenario and ask who is responsible. If it's about oversight, approval, or strategic direction, the answer involves the board or senior executives, meaning governance. If it's about implementation, operations, or technical decisions, the answer involves IT management. <break time='0.5s'/> Another trap: sometimes candidates think governance only applies to large enterprises. Wrong. Every organization, regardless of size, needs governance. The formality might differ, but the function is essential. <break time='1s'/> One more key point: Governance and management are not separate silos. They interact continuously. The board provides direction, management reports on performance, the board evaluates results and adjusts direction. It's a cycle. <break time='0.5s'/> Lock this in: Governance equals direction and oversight. Management equals execution and operations. Board governs. CIO manages.
