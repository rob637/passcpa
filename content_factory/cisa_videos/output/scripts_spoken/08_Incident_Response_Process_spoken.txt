The SIS-uh exam loves to test your Incident Response knowledge... especially the critical first steps and how to properly contain an incident. Get these wrong, and you're leaving points on the table.

Incident Response is the organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack... It's all about limiting damage and restoring systems quickly. Auditors care because a well-defined and tested IR plan demonstrates due diligence and reduces financial and reputational risk after an incident. Think Sarbanes-Oxley compliance... if you can't demonstrate effective incident response, you're opening yourself up to material weaknesses.

The trap is. eye-SAH-kah loves to throw out answer options that sound good but are out of order. For example, they might list "eradication" or "recovery" as the first step. The correct answer is ALWAYS preparation. You can't respond effectively if you haven't planned and prepared beforehand. Think about it... testing, training, creating playbooks - all BEFORE an incident occurs. Don't fall for the tempting "quick fix" answers.

For example, when auditing a company's incident response plan, you might find a detailed recovery plan but no evidence of regular training or simulations. This would be a major finding. Containment is also often misunderstood. Incident containment means isolating the affected systems to prevent further spread of the incident. It’s not eradication... It’s not full recovery... It’s about damage control and preventing the attacker from moving laterally.

Remember this: Preparation is always the FIRST step in incident response. Get that right, and you're one step closer to passing the SIS-uh!
