Welcome to Domain 3: Information Systems Acquisition, Development, and Implementation. <break time='0.5s'/> At eighteen percent, this is an important domain on the exam. But don't underestimate it. The questions here can be tricky because they test whether you understand the full system development lifecycle. <break time='1s'/> The core question of Domain 3 is this: When an organization builds or buys a system, are appropriate controls in place throughout the process? <break time='0.8s'/> Let me walk you through the territory. <break time='0.5s'/> First: The System Development Life Cycle, or S.D.L.C.. This is the backbone of Domain 3. You need to know the phases: feasibility study, requirements definition, design, development, testing, implementation, and post-implementation review. Each phase has specific control objectives. <break time='0.8s'/> Second: Methodologies. Waterfall versus Agile. Traditional versus iterative. The exam will test whether you know the differences and when each approach is appropriate. More importantly, you need to know how audit procedures differ based on the methodology used. <break time='0.8s'/> Third: Testing. Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing, regression testing. What's the purpose of each? What order do they occur? Who's responsible? <break time='0.8s'/> Fourth: Change Management. Once a system is in production, how do changes get approved, tested, and implemented? This is a critical control area because unauthorized changes can introduce vulnerabilities or instability. <break time='0.5s'/> Fifth: Data Migration. When moving from an old system to a new system, how do you ensure data integrity? This is often overlooked but heavily tested. <break time='1s'/> From an auditor's perspective, we're looking for segregation of duties throughout the lifecycle. Developers shouldn't have access to production. Users should be involved in testing and approval. Changes should be authorized, tested, and documented. <break time='0.5s'/> The exam loves scenarios where something goes wrong during implementation. Your job is to identify what control was missing or bypassed. <break time='0.8s'/> Let's build your S.D.L.C. knowledge.
