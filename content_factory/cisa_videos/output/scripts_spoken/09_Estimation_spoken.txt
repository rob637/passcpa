Hey everyone, and welcome! ... I'm here to help you conquer the SEE-suh exam. Did you know that a significant number of people fail the Information Systems Auditing Process domain? ... It's often because they stumble on seemingly small details, like understanding function points. Imagine missing out on a certification because you didn't fully grasp one concept. Today, we're going to make sure that doesn't happen to you. We'll be diving deep into function point analysis. ...

Okay, so what are function points? ... Simply put, function point analysis, or FPA, is a standardized method for measuring the size of software applications. ... We're talking about quantifying the functionality that a system provides to its users. ... Key terms here are functionality, meaning what the software does, and measurement. ... Think of it as counting the features from the user’s perspective.

Why does this matter for auditors? ... Well, as IS auditors, we need to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of I-T projects. ... Function points help us do that. ... They provide a consistent way to estimate development effort, track project progress, and compare the productivity of different development teams. ... Think about this: you're auditing a project that's significantly over budget and behind schedule. ... Understanding function points allows you to analyze whether the original scope was accurately estimated, or if scope creep is the real culprit. ... You can also use it to compare the project's productivity against industry benchmarks. ... Without a solid understanding of function points, you're essentially flying blind, making it difficult to provide meaningful recommendations. ...

Now, let's talk about exam traps. ... eye-SAH-kah loves to trick you with these! ...

First, watch out for questions that focus on lines of code as a measure of software size. ... Function points are based on functionality, not the number of code lines. ... Lines of code are language-dependent and don't accurately reflect the complexity or value delivered to the user. ... Function points are language-independent.

Second, don't confuse function points with technical complexity factors. ... While technical complexity does influence the effort required to develop software, it's a separate consideration. ... Function points primarily measure the user-facing functionality. ... Technical complexity factors are applied after the unadjusted function point count is determined. ...

Third, the answer that looks right, but isn't. ... eye-SAH-kah might offer an answer that correctly defines function points but fails to address what it's used for in an audit context. ... Always choose the answer that demonstrates the practical application of function points in information systems auditing. ... For example, an answer choice might say "Function points measure software size" which is true, but a better answer would be "Function points help auditors assess project efficiency and scope management."

Finally, be wary of questions that mix up the different types of function points. ... While we're focusing on the basic concept, be aware that there are different methodologies, like IFPUG (International Function Point Users Group), which is a common standard. ... Questions may try to throw you off by referencing less common or outdated methods. ... Stick with the widely accepted standards like IFPUG in your thinking.

Let's dive into some examples. ...

Let's say you're auditing a company that's developing a new online banking application. ... To use function points, you would first identify the key user functions: inputs, outputs, inquiries, logical internal files, and external interface files. ...

For example, a user input might be a "transfer funds" screen. ... An output could be an account statement. ... An inquiry might be a balance check. ...

Next, you'd classify each of these functions based on their complexity: simple, average, or complex. ... This classification is based on factors like the number of data elements and file references involved. ...

Then, you assign a weight to each function based on its type and complexity. ... These weights are defined in the IFPUG methodology. ...

Finally, you calculate the unadjusted function point count by summing the weighted values of all the functions. ... This gives you a baseline measure of the application's size. ... Remember, this is the unadjusted function point count! You then apply technical complexity factors to arrive at the adjusted function point count.

Okay, one more example. ... You are auditing a system upgrade. The project manager states that the upgrade added 5000 lines of code. How can you use function points to evaluate this project? First, you would identify the new user functionality added by the upgrade, not just the lines of code changed. ... Then, you would determine the function point count associated with that new functionality. ... Finally, you can compare the cost per function point for the upgrade to industry averages or previous projects to assess the upgrade's cost-effectiveness.

Let's make this stick. ... Let's use a mnemonic: Functional Understanding Necessitates Careful Thinking Pertaining To Size. ... FUNCT PTS. Think of it as "Fun Cats Points," but with a "T" in there. ... Whatever helps you remember! ... Visually, imagine a set of building blocks, each representing a function. ... The more blocks, the bigger the application, and the more function points it has. ... Think of it like counting the individual Lego bricks in a massive Lego castle.

If you remember nothing else: ...

1. Function points measure functionality, not lines of code. ...
2. They're essential for auditors to assess project efficiency and scope. ...
3. Be aware of the common exam traps related to technical complexity and different methodologies. ...

You've got this! By mastering concepts like function points, you're well on your way to SEE-suh success. ... Keep studying, and I'll see you in the next video!
