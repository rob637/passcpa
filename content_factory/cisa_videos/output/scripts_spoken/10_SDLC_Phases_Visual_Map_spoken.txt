The System Development Life Cycle has seven phases. Let's create a visual map you can recall during the exam. <break time='0.8s'/> Think of it as building a house. <break time='0.5s'/> Phase one: Feasibility Study. Can we build this? Should we? This is where you assess technical feasibility, economic viability, and operational practicality. You're answering: Does this project make sense? <break time='0.8s'/> Phase two: Requirements Definition. What exactly are we building? You gather detailed requirements from stakeholders. Functional requirements say what the system must do. Non-functional requirements cover performance, security, and usability. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase three: Design. How will we build it? This includes architecture, database design, interface design, and security design. You're creating the blueprints. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase four: Development. Building time. Programmers write code. Configurations are set. The system takes shape. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase five: Testing. Does it work? Unit testing checks individual components. Integration testing checks how components work together. System testing checks the whole thing. UAT, or user acceptance testing, confirms it meets user needs. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase six: Implementation. Go live. The system moves to production. Users are trained. Data is migrated. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase seven: Post-Implementation Review. Did we succeed? You evaluate whether the project met its objectives and capture lessons learned. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: Think FRDDITD. Feasibility, Requirements, Design, Development, Implementation, Testing, Documentation. Or use a phrase: Friendly Rabbits Don't Destroy Tall Indoor Plants. <break time='0.5s'/> Wait, I mixed up the order. Testing comes before Implementation. Let's use: FRDDT-IP. Feasibility, Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Implementation, Post-review. <break time='0.5s'/> Better phrase: Friendly Rabbits Design Dope Technology, Implement Perfectly.
