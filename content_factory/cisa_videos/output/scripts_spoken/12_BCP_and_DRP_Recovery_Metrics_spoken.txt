Three metrics you absolutely must know for the exam: R.T.O., R.P.O., and M.T.D.. Let's lock them in. <break time='0.8s'/> R.P.O.: Recovery Point Objective. Ask yourself: How much data can I lose? R.P.O. measures backward in time. If your R.P.O. is four hours, you need backups at least every four hours. Losing more than four hours of data would be unacceptable. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: R.P.O. looks backward. P for Past. Point in the past we can recover to. <break time='1s'/> R.T.O.: Recovery Time Objective. Ask yourself: How fast must I recover? R.T.O. measures forward from the disaster. If your R.T.O. is four hours, you must have systems running again within four hours of the disruption. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: R.T.O. looks forward. T for Time to recover. <break time='1s'/> M.T.D.: Maximum Tolerable Downtime. Ask yourself: How long can the business survive? M.T.D. is the absolute limit. Beyond M.T.D., the organization faces catastrophic consequences, potentially going out of business. <break time='0.5s'/> M.T.D. should always be greater than R.T.O.. If your M.T.D. is eight hours, your R.T.O. better be less than that. <break time='0.8s'/> Here's how they relate. R.P.O. determines your backup strategy. R.T.O. determines your recovery strategy. M.T.D. determines your business continuity requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> Quick visual: Disaster strikes at time zero. R.P.O. looks back, asking how much data we lost. R.T.O. looks forward, asking how long until we're running. M.T.D. is the absolute deadline. <break time='0.5s'/> One more phrase to remember: Point in the Past, Time to recover, Maximum Tolerable. R.P.O., R.T.O., M.T.D..
