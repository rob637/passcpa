Business Continuity Planning versus Disaster Recovery Planning. The exam expects you to know the difference. <break time='1s'/> Let's start with definitions. <break time='0.8s'/> Business Continuity Planning, B.C.P., focuses on keeping critical business functions operating during and after a disruption. It's business-focused. It's proactive. It asks: How do we keep serving customers even when something goes wrong? <break time='0.8s'/> Disaster Recovery Planning, D.R.P., focuses on restoring IT systems and data after a disruption. It's technology-focused. It's reactive. It asks: How do we get our systems back up after they go down? <break time='1s'/> Think of it this way: B.C.P. keeps the business running. D.R.P. brings IT back. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's a scenario to make it concrete. A fire destroys your main office. <break time='0.5s'/> B.C.P. determines: Where do employees work? How do we answer customer calls? How do we process orders? It might involve alternate work locations, cross-trained staff, and manual workarounds. <break time='0.5s'/> D.R.P. determines: How do we restore email? How do we recover the database? How do we reconnect to the network? It involves backup restoration, alternate data centers, and system failover. <break time='1s'/> Key exam point: B.C.P. is broader. D.R.P. is a subset of B.C.P.. You need both, but business continuity is the bigger picture. <break time='0.8s'/> Another distinction: Scope. B.C.P. covers the whole organization, including people, processes, facilities, and technology. D.R.P. primarily covers technology and data. <break time='0.8s'/> Who's responsible? B.C.P. is owned by business leadership, often through a steering committee. D.R.P. is owned by IT, typically the C.I.O. or IT director. But both require executive sponsorship. <break time='0.5s'/> One more exam trap: They might describe a plan and ask you to identify it. If it's about maintaining business operations, it's B.C.P.. If it's specifically about restoring IT infrastructure, it's D.R.P..
