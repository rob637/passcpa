Let's go deep on recovery objectives because the exam will test your ability to apply these concepts. <break time='0.8s'/> Recovery Point Objective: How much data loss is acceptable. <break time='0.5s'/> This drives your backup strategy. If your R.P.O. is zero, you need real-time replication. No data loss is acceptable. This is expensive but required for some systems. If your R.P.O. is twenty-four hours, daily backups are sufficient. You can afford to lose up to a day of work. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam application: A question describes a system with hourly backups. A failure occurs at three P.M., and the last backup was at one P.M.. What's the data loss? Two hours. Is this acceptable? Only if the R.P.O. is two hours or greater. <break time='1s'/> Recovery Time Objective: How quickly must systems be operational. <break time='0.5s'/> This drives your recovery strategy. If your R.T.O. is near zero, you need hot standby systems ready to take over immediately. Expensive, but necessary for critical systems. If your R.T.O. is seventy-two hours, you have time to restore from backups and potentially use a cold site. Less expensive, appropriate for non-critical systems. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam application: A question asks about choosing between recovery sites. Hot sites have fastest R.T.O., highest cost. Cold sites have slowest R.T.O., lowest cost. Match the site type to the business requirements. <break time='1s'/> Maximum Tolerable Downtime: The survival threshold. <break time='0.5s'/> M.T.D. is determined through Business Impact Analysis. It answers: At what point does this outage threaten the organization's survival? M.T.D. is always defined by business leadership, not IT. <break time='0.8s'/> Here's the critical relationship: R.T.O. must be less than M.T.D.. If M.T.D. is seventy-two hours and your R.T.O. is ninety-six hours, you have a gap. You'll recover, but it might be too late. <break time='0.5s'/> One more nuance: Different systems have different objectives. Your customer-facing website might have an R.T.O. of one hour. Your HR system might have an R.T.O. of seventy-two hours. You tier your systems based on criticality and allocate recovery resources accordingly.
