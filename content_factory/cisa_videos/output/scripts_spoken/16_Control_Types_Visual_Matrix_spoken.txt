Control types is one of the most frequently tested topics in Domain 5. Let's create a mental matrix you can recall instantly. <break time='0.8s'/> There are three primary control types based on timing. Preventive controls stop bad things before they happen. Detective controls identify bad things while or after they happen. Corrective controls fix things after something goes wrong. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory phrase: P.D.C.. Prevent, Detect, Correct. Or: Please Don't Crash. <break time='1s'/> Now let's populate each category with examples. <break time='0.5s'/> Preventive: Access controls that block unauthorized users. Encryption that keeps data unreadable. Segregation of duties that prevents fraud. Training that stops user errors. Think: anything that blocks or stops. <break time='0.8s'/> Detective: Audit logs that record activity. Intrusion detection systems that alert on attacks. Reconciliations that identify discrepancies. Reviews that catch errors. Think: anything that watches or alerts. <break time='0.8s'/> Corrective: Backups that restore lost data. Disaster recovery that brings systems back. Incident response that contains breaches. Patches that fix vulnerabilities. Think: anything that fixes or restores. <break time='1s'/> Two more control types to know. Deterrent controls discourage bad behavior. Security cameras and warning signs are examples. They don't directly prevent or detect, but they reduce likelihood. <break time='0.5s'/> Compensating controls provide alternative protection when primary controls can't be implemented. If you can't segregate duties because your team is too small, a compensating control might be management review of all transactions. <break time='0.8s'/> Lock it in: P.D.C. plus deterrent and compensating. Prevent, Detect, Correct, Discourage, Compensate.
