I'm James, and I'm going to share insider knowledge about how ISACA constructs exam questions. Once you see the patterns, these questions become much more manageable. <break time='1s'/> First, understand the question structure. CISA questions are scenario-based multiple choice. You'll get a situation, a specific question, and four choices. Only one answer is the best answer. <break time='0.5s'/> Notice I said best answer, not correct answer. Often, two or three options could work in the real world. Your job is to identify the most appropriate response according to ISACA standards. <break time='1s'/> Let's talk about common question patterns. <break time='0.8s'/> Pattern one: The first step question. The scenario describes a situation and asks: What should the auditor do first? The trap is choosing an action that's valid but not the first step. Usually, the first step involves understanding the situation, assessing risk, or planning before jumping to action. <break time='0.8s'/> Pattern two: The most important question. Several controls or actions are listed. Which is most important? The answer typically relates to the factor with the greatest risk impact or the foundational element that enables everything else. <break time='0.8s'/> Pattern three: The best answer question. All four options seem reasonable. You need to identify the one that most directly addresses the scenario. Eliminate distractors by asking: Does this specifically solve the problem described? <break time='1s'/> How to eliminate wrong answers. <break time='0.5s'/> Look for absolutes. Words like always, never, or must are often traps. Security and audit rarely deal in absolutes. <break time='0.5s'/> Watch for out-of-scope answers. If the question is about audit planning, an answer about audit reporting is probably wrong. <break time='0.5s'/> Beware of technically correct but inappropriate answers. An action might be valid but not appropriate for the specific role or timing described. <break time='1s'/> Final tip: Think like a CISA, not an IT technician. The exam tests whether you think like an auditor. Your job is to assess, evaluate, and provide assurance. You're not the implementer. When in doubt, choose the answer that demonstrates professional skepticism, evidence-based judgment, and appropriate communication.
