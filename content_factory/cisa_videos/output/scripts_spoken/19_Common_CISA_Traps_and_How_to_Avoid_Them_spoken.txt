Let me share the most common traps I've seen candidates fall into and how to avoid them. <break time='1s'/> Trap one: Recommending implementation. <break time='0.5s'/> The question describes a control weakness and asks what the auditor should do. Many candidates choose an answer that says the auditor should implement the missing control. Wrong. Auditors don't implement. We recommend, we report, we advise. But we don't do the remediation ourselves. That would compromise our independence. <break time='0.5s'/> When you see this trap, look for the answer that involves reporting to management or recommending corrective action. <break time='1s'/> Trap two: Scope creep. <break time='0.5s'/> During an audit of System A, you discover problems with System B. The question asks your next step. The trap answer is to immediately investigate System B. The correct approach is to note the finding, complete your current scope, and report the issue for potential future audit coverage. Auditors work within defined scope. <break time='1s'/> Trap three: Bypassing management. <break time='0.5s'/> You discover fraud. The question asks who you should tell. The trap is to choose the external auditors or law enforcement. Generally, you first inform appropriate management and let them decide on escalation, unless management is involved in the fraud. Then you go to the audit committee or board. <break time='1s'/> Trap four: Relying on inadequate evidence. <break time='0.5s'/> You conducted interviews and reviewed documentation. The question asks if you have sufficient evidence. Interview evidence alone is weak because it's based on what people say, not what they do. You need corroborating evidence. If the only evidence is verbal, the answer is usually that more testing is needed. <break time='1s'/> Trap five: Ignoring materiality and risk. <break time='0.5s'/> Not all findings deserve the same attention. A question might present a minor issue and ask your response. The trap is treating everything as critical. Auditors consider materiality and relative risk. A minor control gap in a low-risk area doesn't warrant emergency escalation. <break time='0.5s'/> Remember these traps. They appear repeatedly in different forms.
