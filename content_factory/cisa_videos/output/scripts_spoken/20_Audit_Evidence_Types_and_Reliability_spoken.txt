Not all evidence is created equal. On the CISA exam, you need to know which evidence is most reliable and why. <break time='0.8s'/> Let's establish the hierarchy. <break time='1s'/> Evidence obtained directly by the auditor is more reliable than evidence provided by others. If I personally observe a control being performed, that's stronger than if someone tells me they perform the control. <break time='0.8s'/> Evidence obtained from independent sources outside the organization is more reliable than evidence from within. A bank confirmation of account balances beats an internal spreadsheet. <break time='0.8s'/> Documentary evidence is more reliable than verbal representations. Written policies beat verbal descriptions of how things work. <break time='0.8s'/> Original documents are more reliable than copies. Faxes and photocopies can be altered. <break time='1s'/> Now let's categorize the types. <break time='0.5s'/> Physical observation. You watch someone perform the control. Highly reliable because you see it yourself, but it only proves the control operated at that moment. <break time='0.8s'/> Documentation review. You examine policies, procedures, logs, configurations. Provides evidence of design and historical operation, but documents can be falsified. <break time='0.8s'/> Inquiry and interview. You ask questions and get verbal responses. Useful for understanding processes but weakest standing alone because people might not tell the truth or might not know the truth. <break time='0.8s'/> Re-performance. You perform the control yourself to verify it works. Very strong because you're testing directly, but time-consuming. <break time='0.8s'/> Analytical procedures. You examine patterns and relationships in data. Useful for detecting anomalies, but requires corroboration. <break time='1s'/> Exam tip: If a question asks whether you have sufficient evidence and the only evidence is interview responses, the answer is usually no. You need corroborating evidence from other sources.
