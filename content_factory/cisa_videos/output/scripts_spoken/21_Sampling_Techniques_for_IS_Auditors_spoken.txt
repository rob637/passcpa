When you can't test everything, you sample. But how you sample matters enormously for the validity of your conclusions. <break time='1s'/> Two fundamental approaches: statistical and non-statistical, also called judgmental. <break time='0.8s'/> Statistical sampling uses mathematical principles. You select samples randomly, and the math lets you project results to the entire population with measurable confidence. You can make statements like: We are ninety-five percent confident the error rate is below two percent. <break time='0.5s'/> Non-statistical sampling relies on auditor judgment. You choose items based on experience, risk factors, or specific criteria. It's valid when done properly, but you cannot mathematically project results to the population. <break time='1s'/> When do you use each? <break time='0.5s'/> Use statistical sampling when you need to quantify risk, when the population is large and homogeneous, and when you need defensible, objective results. <break time='0.5s'/> Use judgmental sampling when you're targeting high-risk items specifically, when the population is small, or when statistical sampling isn't practical. <break time='1s'/> Key statistical concepts for the exam. <break time='0.5s'/> Confidence level: How certain are you in your results? Common levels are ninety and ninety-five percent. Higher confidence requires larger samples. <break time='0.5s'/> Tolerable error rate: The maximum error you're willing to accept. Lower tolerance requires larger samples. <break time='0.5s'/> Expected error rate: What you think you'll find based on prior audits. Higher expected error requires larger samples. <break time='0.8s'/> Sample size relationship: Larger populations need larger samples, but the relationship isn't linear. Sampling two hundred from a population of ten thousand gives almost as much confidence as sampling from one million.
