Two types of testing, two different purposes. Let's make sure you never confuse them. <break time='1s'/> Compliance testing, also called tests of controls, asks: Is the control being followed? <break time='0.5s'/> You're testing adherence to policies and procedures. Does management approve high-value transactions as required? Are backups performed according to schedule? Is access review conducted quarterly as policy states? <break time='0.8s'/> You're not testing whether the underlying data is correct. You're testing whether the control operates as designed. <break time='1s'/> Substantive testing asks: Is the data accurate and complete? <break time='0.5s'/> You're testing the information itself. Does the inventory count match the records? Are the account balances correct? Can all transactions be traced to supporting documentation? <break time='0.8s'/> You're not testing whether someone followed a procedure. You're testing whether the result is right. <break time='1s'/> Here's how they work together. <break time='0.5s'/> If compliance testing shows controls are operating effectively, you can reduce the extent of your substantive testing. You have assurance that the controls are catching errors. <break time='0.5s'/> If compliance testing shows controls are weak or not followed, you need more substantive testing. You can't rely on the controls, so you must test the data directly. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam trap: A question might describe a data accuracy issue and ask which type of testing applies. Data accuracy equals substantive. A question about whether someone follows procedures equals compliance. <break time='0.5s'/> Remember: Compliance checks Conformance to controls. Substantive checks the Substance of the data.
