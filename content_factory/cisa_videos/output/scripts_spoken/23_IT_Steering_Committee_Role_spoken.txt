Hey SEE-suh candidates, ready to tackle the I-T Steering Committee? Nail this, and you’ll boost your exam score.

What is the I-T Steering Committee? It’s a high-level group responsible for aligning I-T strategy with business objectives... ensuring I-T investments deliver value. Auditors care deeply, because a well-functioning committee means stronger I-T governance and risk management. Think about it...a weak committee equals weak controls and potential audit findings.

Now, here’s the exam trap. eye-SAH-kah loves to present options focusing solely on technical expertise when defining committee composition. The trap is thinking it’s all about CIOs and tech leads. The correct answer is... a diverse group including business stakeholders, senior management, and then I-T representatives. Remember, it’s about business alignment FIRST. eye-SAH-kah also likes to blur lines on responsibilities... making it seem like the committee implements I-T projects. No! They oversee and prioritize.

For example, when auditing a new ERP system implementation, check if the I-T Steering Committee approved the project charter, reviewed progress reports, and ensured business units were actively involved. This demonstrates effective oversight, not just I-T pushing a project.

Your one takeaway? The I-T Steering Committee is about business-driven I-T governance... not just technical management. Master that, and you've got this!
