You walk into the office Monday morning, and your manager hands you an assignment. You're going to lead the I.S. audit of the company's new customer relationship management system. It went live three months ago. <break time='0.5s'/> Let's walk through this together. <break time='1s'/> First question you should ask: What's the scope? <break time='0.5s'/> Your manager clarifies: Focus on access controls and data integrity. The system handles sensitive customer information, so the board wants assurance that only authorized personnel can access it and that the data is reliable. <break time='0.8s'/> Now you start planning. What do you do first? <break time='0.5s'/> You request documentation: the system security plan, access control matrix, user provisioning procedures, data validation rules, and any previous audit reports or risk assessments. You also schedule preliminary meetings with the system owner and IT security team. <break time='1s'/> During planning, you assess risk. <break time='0.5s'/> Three months is new. The implementation team might still be tweaking things. That's higher inherent risk. You note that you'll want to verify change controls are in place. <break time='0.5s'/> It's customer data. High sensitivity means high impact if compromised. You'll do more testing in access controls than you might for an internal administrative system. <break time='1s'/> You develop your audit program. For access controls, you'll review the access matrix, test a sample of user accounts against their job functions, verify that terminated employees have been removed, and check administrative account usage. <break time='0.5s'/> For data integrity, you'll review input validation controls, trace a sample of records from source documents to the database, and check for duplicate or orphan records. <break time='1s'/> Now you execute. You conduct interviews, review documentation, and perform testing. You find three issues: five terminated employees still have active accounts, administrative password changes haven't been enforced, and there's no audit log review process. <break time='0.5s'/> What do you do? <break time='0.5s'/> You document your findings with evidence. You assess severity. The terminated employee accounts are high risk. You draft findings and schedule an exit conference. <break time='0.8s'/> At the exit conference, management acknowledges the issues and commits to remediation. You issue your report with findings, recommendations, and management's response. <break time='0.5s'/> Three months later, you'll follow up to verify the issues were addressed. <break time='0.5s'/> That's the audit lifecycle in action.
