ITIL isn't a governance framework like COBIT. It's a service management framework. And as an IS auditor, you need to understand what it does and when to reference it. <break time='1s'/> ITIL stands for Information Technology Infrastructure Library. It's a set of best practices for IT service management, or ITSM. The focus is on delivering value through services. <break time='0.8s'/> The current version is ITIL 4, which emphasizes the service value system. But for the exam, you need concepts more than version specifics. <break time='1s'/> The core idea: IT exists to provide services to the business. ITIL defines how to design, deliver, and improve those services efficiently and effectively. <break time='0.8s'/> Key ITIL processes you should know. <break time='1s'/> Incident Management: Restoring normal service as quickly as possible when something breaks. An incident is an unplanned interruption. The goal is to minimize business impact. <break time='0.8s'/> Problem Management: Finding the root cause of incidents and preventing recurrence. A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. While incident management is reactive, problem management is proactive. <break time='0.8s'/> Change Management: Controlling changes to the IT environment. All changes should be assessed for risk, approved, tested, and documented. This prevents unauthorized or poorly planned changes from causing incidents. <break time='0.8s'/> Service Desk: The single point of contact between IT and users. Users report issues here, and the service desk manages communication and ticket routing. <break time='1s'/> As an auditor, you evaluate whether these processes exist, whether they're followed, and whether they're effective. <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: Changes made without proper approval. Incidents not properly tracked or escalated. Root cause analysis not performed after major incidents. No service level agreements or SLAs not monitored. <break time='0.5s'/> Remember: COBIT asks if IT is doing the right things. ITIL helps IT do things right.
