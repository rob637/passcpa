ISO 27001 and 27002 are the international standards for information security management. They're frequently referenced on the CISA exam, so let's clarify what each one does. <break time='1s'/> ISO 27001 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an Information Security Management System, or ISMS. It's certifiable, meaning organizations can be audited and certified as compliant. <break time='0.5s'/> The core concept is the ISMS framework: Plan, Do, Check, Act. You establish security objectives, implement controls, monitor effectiveness, and continuously improve. <break time='1s'/> ISO 27002 provides detailed guidance on security controls. Think of it as the implementation guide. It describes control objectives and controls across domains like access control, cryptography, physical security, and incident management. <break time='0.5s'/> The relationship: 27001 says what you must do. 27002 says how to do it. <break time='1s'/> Key components of ISO 27001 for the exam. <break time='0.8s'/> Risk assessment: You must identify information assets, assess threats and vulnerabilities, and determine risk levels. <break time='0.8s'/> Statement of Applicability: A documented list of controls selected from the standard and justification for inclusions and exclusions. <break time='0.8s'/> Internal audits: The standard requires regular internal audits of the ISMS. <break time='0.8s'/> Management review: Top management must review the ISMS periodically to ensure its continuing suitability and effectiveness. <break time='1s'/> As an IS auditor, if the organization claims ISO 27001 certification, you can request evidence of that certification and use the standard as a benchmark. If they're not certified but reference the standard, you verify their actual practices against their claims. <break time='0.5s'/> Exam application: If a question mentions security standards or information security management systems, ISO 27000 series is usually the relevant reference.
