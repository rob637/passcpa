Risk management is foundational to everything we audit. Let's understand the major frameworks, with particular focus on COSO, which frequently appears on the CISA exam. <break time='1s'/> COSO stands for Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. They published two major frameworks: the Internal Control Framework and the Enterprise Risk Management, or E.R.M., Framework. <break time='0.8s'/> The COSO Internal Control Framework defines internal control as having five components. <break time='0.5s'/> Control Environment: The tone at the top, ethics, and organizational culture that influence control consciousness. <break time='0.5s'/> Risk Assessment: Identifying and analyzing risks that could prevent achieving objectives. <break time='0.5s'/> Control Activities: The policies and procedures that ensure management directives are carried out. <break time='0.5s'/> Information and Communication: Capturing and exchanging information needed to conduct, manage, and control operations. <break time='0.5s'/> Monitoring Activities: Ongoing evaluations to ensure controls are present and functioning. <break time='1s'/> Memory aid for the five components: CRIME. Control environment, Risk assessment, Information and communication, Monitoring, control Event activities. Or just remember the first letters: C-R-C-I-M. <break time='1s'/> COSO E.R.M. takes a broader view, integrating risk management with strategy and performance. It emphasizes that risk is not just about avoiding bad outcomes but also about enabling value creation. <break time='0.8s'/> Key concept: Risk appetite is the amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. Risk tolerance is the acceptable variation around specific objectives. <break time='0.8s'/> As an auditor evaluating risk management, you assess whether the organization has a defined risk appetite, whether risks are systematically identified and assessed, whether risk responses are appropriate, and whether monitoring exists to track risk levels and control effectiveness. <break time='0.5s'/> The exam expects you to recognize when an organization's risk management practices are inadequate and to identify which component of the framework is missing.
