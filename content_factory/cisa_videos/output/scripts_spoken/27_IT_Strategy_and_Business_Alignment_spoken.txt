One of the most critical governance issues is whether IT strategy aligns with business strategy. Let's understand what alignment means and how to audit it. <break time='1s'/> Business alignment means IT investments, priorities, and activities support the organization's business objectives. IT shouldn't pursue technology for technology's sake. Every initiative should have a clear business justification. <break time='0.8s'/> Signs of good alignment: The IT strategic plan explicitly references business objectives. IT investments are prioritized based on business value. Business leaders are involved in IT steering committees. IT performance metrics connect to business outcomes. <break time='0.8s'/> Signs of poor alignment: IT projects that nobody asked for. Business complaining that IT doesn't understand their needs. No IT representation in business planning. Technology decisions made in isolation from business strategy. <break time='1s'/> How do you audit alignment? <break time='0.5s'/> First, obtain the business strategic plan and the IT strategic plan. Read them. Do they reference each other? Can you trace IT initiatives to business objectives? <break time='0.5s'/> Second, interview business executives. Do they feel IT supports their priorities? Do they understand IT's direction? <break time='0.5s'/> Third, review IT governance structures. Is there a steering committee? Who's on it? Do they meet regularly? Who approves IT investments? <break time='0.5s'/> Fourth, examine IT investment decisions. What criteria are used? Is business value assessed? How are projects prioritized? <break time='1s'/> Exam scenario: You discover IT is spending millions on infrastructure upgrades, but no business case exists and business leaders are unaware. What's the finding? IT investments are not aligned with business strategy and lack proper governance approval. <break time='0.5s'/> The recommendation: Establish an IT steering committee with business representation and require business case justification for all significant IT investments.
