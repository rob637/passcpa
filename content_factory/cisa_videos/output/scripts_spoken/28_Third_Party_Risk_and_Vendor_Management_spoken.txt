Organizations increasingly rely on third parties: cloud providers, outsourcers, software vendors, contractors. Every third party relationship introduces risk that must be managed. <break time='1s'/> Third-party risk includes several categories. <break time='0.5s'/> Operational risk: The vendor might fail to deliver services as expected, causing business disruption. <break time='0.5s'/> Security risk: The vendor might have weak security, exposing your data or systems. <break time='0.5s'/> Compliance risk: The vendor's practices might not meet your regulatory requirements, and you're still accountable. <break time='0.5s'/> Financial risk: The vendor might have financial troubles and go out of business. <break time='0.5s'/> Reputational risk: The vendor's problems become your problems in the eyes of customers and regulators. <break time='1s'/> What controls should exist? <break time='0.8s'/> Due diligence before engagement. Assess the vendor's security practices, financial stability, reputation, and capabilities before signing a contract. <break time='0.8s'/> Contractual protections. The contract should specify security requirements, audit rights, data handling obligations, service levels, and termination provisions. <break time='0.8s'/> Ongoing monitoring. Regularly assess vendor performance against contracts. Request SOC reports, conduct periodic audits, and monitor security posture. <break time='0.8s'/> Exit strategy. Have a plan for what happens if you need to end the relationship. How do you get your data back? How do you transition services? <break time='1s'/> Exam tip: A question might describe a data breach at a vendor resulting in exposure of customer information. Who is responsible? You are. You can outsource the work, but you cannot outsource the accountability. <break time='0.5s'/> The auditor's role: Assess whether third-party risk is properly identified, contracts include appropriate protections, and ongoing monitoring exists.
