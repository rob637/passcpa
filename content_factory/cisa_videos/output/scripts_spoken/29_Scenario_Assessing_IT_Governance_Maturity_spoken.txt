The board of directors is concerned about IT governance. They've asked for an assessment because they keep hearing about strategic misalignment, budget overruns, and security gaps. Your job: evaluate the maturity of IT governance and provide recommendations. <break time='1s'/> Where do you start? <break time='0.5s'/> You begin by understanding the governance structures. Who's responsible for IT oversight? Is there an IT steering committee? Who's on it? How often do they meet? What decisions do they make? <break time='0.5s'/> You request the IT charter, committee meeting minutes, and strategic planning documents. <break time='1s'/> You discover: There's an IT steering committee, but it hasn't met in eight months. Membership includes the C.I.O. and IT directors, but no business executives. There's no formal IT strategic plan. Large projects are approved informally by whoever has budget authority. <break time='0.5s'/> Already you're seeing gaps. Let's dig deeper. <break time='1s'/> You look at policy and frameworks. Does the organization reference any governance frameworks? Do policies exist for IT investment decisions, risk management, and performance measurement? <break time='0.5s'/> You find: policies exist but are outdated. They reference COBIT, but nobody seems to know what that means in practice. There's no formal IT risk register. Performance metrics exist for uptime and ticket resolution, but nothing linking IT to business outcomes. <break time='1s'/> You interview key stakeholders. The C.I.O. says she doesn't have time for committees and just needs to keep things running. The C.F.O. says he doesn't understand IT spending and doesn't know if it's delivering value. Business unit leaders say IT doesn't understand their priorities. <break time='0.8s'/> Now you assess maturity. Using a framework like COBIT's capability model, you rate each governance area from zero, meaning non-existent, to five, meaning optimized. <break time='0.5s'/> Your assessment: IT strategic planning is at level one, ad hoc. IT oversight is at level two, basic and inconsistent. IT risk management is at level one. Value delivery measurement is at level one. <break time='1s'/> Your recommendations: Re-establish the steering committee with mandatory business representation. Develop an IT strategic plan aligned with business strategy. Implement a formal IT risk management process. Define business-outcome-oriented metrics. <break time='0.5s'/> You present to the board with a roadmap for moving from current state to a target maturity level of three within eighteen months.
