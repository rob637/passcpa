The organization just implemented a new financial system three weeks ago. Shortly after go-live, users started reporting problems: duplicate transactions, missing data, and performance issues. Management wants to know what went wrong. You're conducting a post-implementation audit. <break time='1s'/> You start by gathering information. <break time='0.5s'/> You request the project documentation: business case, requirements specification, design documents, test plans, test results, go-live checklist, and any incident tickets since implementation. <break time='1s'/> What you find is concerning. <break time='0.5s'/> The business case exists but was developed two years ago. Requirements were never formally signed off by users. There's a design document, but it's marked 'draft.' Test results show that U.A.T. was planned for four weeks but completed in one week with several critical defects marked 'deferred.' The go-live decision was made by IT without formal business approval. <break time='1s'/> You conduct interviews. <break time='0.5s'/> The project manager says they were under executive pressure to meet a hard deadline. Testing was compressed when development ran late. The finance team lead says she raised concerns about readiness but was told go-live wasn't optional. The IT director says he believed the system was ready enough and deferred defects were minor. <break time='1s'/> Now you analyze root causes. <break time='0.5s'/> The duplicate transactions trace to a data migration defect that was known but deferred. The missing data stems from incomplete field mapping that wasn't caught because testing was compressed. Performance issues result from inadequate capacity planning. <break time='0.8s'/> You identify control failures: Insufficient U.A.T. because of schedule pressure. No formal go-live approval process. Known defects not properly assessed for go-live risk. Data migration reconciliation incomplete. <break time='1s'/> Your recommendations: For immediate actions, prioritize fixing the critical defects. For process improvements, establish formal go-live criteria that cannot be waived without executive risk acceptance, ensure adequate testing time in future projects, require data migration reconciliation sign-off before go-live, and implement formal business approval for production deployment. <break time='0.5s'/> You present your findings. Management accepts responsibility and commits to remediation.
