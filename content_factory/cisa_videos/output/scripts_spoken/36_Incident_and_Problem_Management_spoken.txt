Incident and problem management are related but distinct processes. Understanding the difference is crucial for the exam. <break time='1s'/> An incident is an unplanned interruption to a service or a reduction in quality. Examples: The email server is down. The application is running slowly. Users cannot log in. <break time='0.5s'/> The goal of incident management is to restore normal service as quickly as possible while minimizing business impact. Speed is the priority. Getting users back to work matters more than understanding why it broke. <break time='1s'/> A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. Examples: The server keeps crashing because of a memory leak. Logins fail during peak hours because of an undersized authentication server. <break time='0.5s'/> The goal of problem management is to identify root causes and prevent incidents from recurring. It's proactive and investigative. <break time='1s'/> Here's the workflow. <break time='0.5s'/> An incident occurs. Incident management springs into action. They diagnose quickly, apply a workaround if needed, and restore service. They log the incident and close it. <break time='0.5s'/> If the incident is serious or keeps happening, problem management opens a problem record. They investigate root cause, identify a permanent fix, and track implementation. The problem remains open until the fix is verified effective. <break time='1s'/> Key exam concept: A workaround is not a solution. Incident management might apply a workaround to restore service, like restarting the server every night to clear the memory leak. But the problem isn't solved until the memory leak is fixed. <break time='0.8s'/> Audit focus: Are incidents logged and categorized? Are major incidents analyzed for root cause? Are problems tracked to resolution? Are workarounds documented with problem tickets?
