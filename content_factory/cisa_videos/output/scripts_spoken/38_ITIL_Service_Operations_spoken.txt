ITIL is the most widely adopted framework for IT service management, and service operations is where IT delivers value day to day. Let's understand the key processes. <break time='1s'/> Service operations has five key processes, and four of them appear frequently on the CISA exam. <break time='0.8s'/> Incident management we've discussed. Restore service quickly. Minimize business impact. The metrics here are mean time to resolve and first call resolution rate. <break time='0.8s'/> Problem management we've also covered. Find root causes. Prevent recurrence. The key artifact is the known error database, which documents problems and their workarounds. <break time='1s'/> Event management is about monitoring and filtering. An event is any change in state that has significance. A server boots? Event. Disk usage hits ninety percent? Event. A user logs in? Event. <break time='0.5s'/> Not all events require action. Event management filters events into three categories: informational, warning, and exception. Only exceptions require immediate response. Good event management prevents alert fatigue. <break time='1s'/> Access management is about granting rights to use services. This implements the policies defined by information security. It's the execution layer. When a new employee starts, access management provisions their accounts according to their role. <break time='0.5s'/> Key principle: access management doesn't decide who gets what access. That's defined elsewhere. Access management just executes those decisions correctly and maintains records. <break time='1s'/> The service desk is the function, not a process. It's the single point of contact between IT and users. All incidents come through the service desk. They log, categorize, prioritize, and either resolve or escalate. <break time='0.5s'/> Exam tip: ITIL distinguishes between processes, which are what you do, and functions, which are who does it. Service desk is a function that executes multiple processes.
