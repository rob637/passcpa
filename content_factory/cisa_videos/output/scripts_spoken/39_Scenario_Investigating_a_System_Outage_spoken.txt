The organization's primary business application went down Friday afternoon and wasn't restored until Saturday morning. Customers couldn't place orders for eighteen hours. The C.E.O. wants to know what happened and how to prevent it from happening again. You're conducting a post-incident review. <break time='1s'/> You gather the facts. <break time='0.5s'/> The incident started at 3:47 P.M. when the application became unresponsive. Users reported errors. The service desk logged the incident at 3:52 P.M.. Initial diagnosis suggested a database problem. The D.B.A. was contacted at 4:15 P.M. but was traveling and had limited connectivity. An alternate D.B.A. wasn't available. <break time='0.5s'/> By 6:00 P.M., they identified a database table lock caused by a long-running query. But the person who could cancel the query without data corruption wasn't reachable. At 11:30 P.M., they reached him by phone. The query was cancelled at 11:45 P.M., but the database required recovery procedures. Service was restored at 2:15 AM. <break time='1s'/> You analyze what went wrong at each stage. <break time='0.5s'/> Detection was reasonable. Five minute gap between incident and report is acceptable. <break time='0.5s'/> Escalation was slow. Thirty minutes to reach the D.B.A., and the backup D.B.A. wasn't available. The escalation procedures didn't identify alternates. <break time='0.5s'/> Resolution was delayed by single points of knowledge. Only one person could safely cancel the query. That knowledge should be documented or others should be trained. <break time='0.5s'/> The root cause was the long-running query itself. Why was a query that could lock the entire application running during business hours? <break time='1s'/> Your findings point to control gaps. <break time='0.5s'/> Escalation procedures were incomplete. They named primary contacts but not alternates. <break time='0.5s'/> Knowledge management was inadequate. Critical procedures were not documented. <break time='0.5s'/> Change management might have failed. Who approved running that query during business hours? Was it even submitted as a change? <break time='0.5s'/> The organization lacked adequate redundancy in staffing and knowledge. <break time='1s'/> Your recommendations: Update escalation procedures with backup contacts and emergency contact methods. Document critical procedures so that more than one person can perform them. Review change management to ensure long-running queries are scheduled appropriately. Consider implementing query timeout controls. <break time='0.5s'/> This scenario illustrates how multiple small weaknesses combine into a major incident.
