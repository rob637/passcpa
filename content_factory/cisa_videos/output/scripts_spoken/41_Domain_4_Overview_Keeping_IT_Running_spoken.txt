Welcome to Domain 4: Information Systems Operations and Business Resilience. I'm David, and I've spent my career keeping critical systems running. <break time='0.8s'/> This is the second largest domain at twenty-three percent. That's roughly thirty-four questions. And here's what makes it special: this is where theory meets the real world. <break time='1s'/> The core question of Domain 4: Can the organization keep its systems running and recover if something goes wrong? <break time='0.8s'/> Let me map out the territory. Domain 4 breaks into two major areas. <break time='0.5s'/> First: IT Operations. This is the day-to-day running of technology. We're talking data center management, batch processing, job scheduling, helpdesk, incident management, problem management. All the things that keep the lights on. <break time='0.8s'/> Second: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. What happens when things go wrong? How do you maintain critical business functions during a disruption? How do you recover systems after a disaster? This includes business impact analysis, recovery strategies, backup and restore, and testing. <break time='1s'/> The exam tests both your knowledge and your judgment. They'll give you scenarios: A server fails. A data center floods. Ransomware encrypts your files. You need to know the correct procedures and priorities. <break time='0.5s'/> Key concepts you'll see repeatedly: RTO, Recovery Time Objective. How quickly must we recover? RPO, Recovery Point Objective. How much data loss is acceptable? MTD, Maximum Tolerable Downtime. How long can the business survive without this system? <break time='0.8s'/> For operations, you'll need to understand incident versus problem management. An incident is an unplanned interruption. A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. We restore service for incidents. We find root causes for problems. <break time='0.8s'/> From an auditor's perspective, we're looking for two things. One: appropriate controls over daily operations. Two: tested, realistic recovery plans that match business requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> I'll help you understand both. Let's dive in.
