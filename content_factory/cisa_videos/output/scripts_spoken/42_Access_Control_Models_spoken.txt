Access control determines who can access what and how. There are several models, each with different characteristics. <break time='1s'/> Discretionary Access Control, or D.A.C.. The resource owner decides who can access, like sharing a file and choosing which coworkers can edit. It's flexible but inconsistent. Security depends on each owner making good decisions. Most personal computers and file shares use D.A.C.. <break time='1s'/> Mandatory Access Control, or M.A.C.. A central authority defines access based on labels. Users have clearance levels. Resources have classification levels. You can only access resources at or below your clearance. <break time='0.5s'/> M.A.C. is rigid but very secure. It's used in military and government systems. Users cannot change access rights, even on their own resources. <break time='1s'/> Role-Based Access Control, or R-back. Access is based on job function. You create roles like 'accounts payable clerk' with specific permissions. When someone gets that job, they get that role. When they change jobs, the role changes. <break time='0.5s'/> R-back is the most common model in enterprises. It's manageable at scale and aligns with organizational structure. <break time='1s'/> Attribute-Based Access Control, or A-back. Access decisions consider multiple attributes: who is requesting, what are they requesting, from where, when, and why. <break time='0.5s'/> For example: Allow access to financial reports if the user is in the finance department, accessing from a corporate device, during business hours, in the same country as the data. <break time='0.5s'/> A-back is flexible and granular but complex to implement. <break time='1s'/> Exam tip: When a question describes access control characteristics, match them to the model. Owner-controlled means D.A.C.. Clearance and classification means M.A.C.. Job function means R-back. Multiple attributes and conditions mean A-back.
