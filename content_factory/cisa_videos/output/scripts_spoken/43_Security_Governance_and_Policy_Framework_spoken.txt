Effective security requires governance. Governance provides direction, ensures objectives are achieved, and manages risk appropriately. <break time='1s'/> The governance structure starts at the top. <break time='0.5s'/> The board of directors has ultimate accountability for security. They set risk appetite and approve major policies. <break time='0.5s'/> Executive management implements the board's direction. The C.E.O. is typically accountable for overall security. A Chief Information Security Officer, or C.I.S.O., leads the security function. <break time='0.5s'/> Security management develops and implements the security program. They create policies, manage risks, and oversee controls. <break time='1s'/> The policy framework has a hierarchy. <break time='0.8s'/> Policies are high-level statements of management intent. They state what must be done but not how. Example: All sensitive data must be protected from unauthorized access. Policies require executive approval and rarely change. <break time='0.8s'/> Standards define specific requirements. They state what specifically must be implemented. Example: All passwords must be at least twelve characters. Standards provide measurable requirements. <break time='0.8s'/> Procedures are step-by-step instructions for how to do something. Example: To reset a password, verify identity using two of three authentication questions, then generate a temporary password, and then force change on first login. <break time='0.8s'/> Guidelines are recommendations and best practices. They're not mandatory. Example: Consider using a password manager to maintain unique passwords for each system. <break time='1s'/> Exam distinction: Policies govern behavior. Standards mandate specifics. Procedures instruct actions. Guidelines suggest approaches. <break time='0.5s'/> As an auditor, you verify that policies exist, are approved, are communicated, and are followed. You check that standards are implemented and procedures are current.
