The organization discovered customer credit card numbers posted on a hacking forum. Management suspects a breach. You're part of the incident response team, and your role is to assess what happened and identify control failures. <break time='1s'/> The investigation reveals a timeline. <break time='0.5s'/> Three months ago, an attacker sent phishing emails to multiple employees. One employee clicked and entered credentials on a fake login page. <break time='0.5s'/> Using those credentials, the attacker accessed the employee's email and found emails containing server credentials. Internal teams had been emailing passwords. <break time='0.5s'/> The attacker used those credentials to access a database server. The account had excessive privileges. It was a generic shared account used by multiple developers. <break time='0.5s'/> The database contained credit card numbers stored in plain text. There was no encryption at rest. <break time='0.5s'/> The attacker exported the data over several weeks. There was no data loss prevention monitoring. Normal database queries didn't trigger alerts. <break time='0.5s'/> The breach was discovered only when the data appeared publicly. <break time='1s'/> You identify multiple control failures at each stage. <break time='0.8s'/> Prevention failures: Security awareness training apparently didn't prevent the phishing success. Email security didn't detect the phishing message. Multifactor authentication wasn't implemented, so stolen credentials were sufficient. <break time='0.8s'/> Access control failures: Credentials were shared via email, violating basic security practices. The database account was shared rather than individual. The account had excessive privileges beyond what was needed. <break time='0.8s'/> Data protection failures: Credit card numbers were stored unencrypted, violating PCI D.S.S. requirements. No data masking or tokenization was implemented. <break time='0.8s'/> Detection failures: No monitoring detected the initial access or ongoing exfiltration. The organization learned of the breach from external sources. <break time='1s'/> Your recommendations address each layer: Implement multifactor authentication. Deploy phishing-resistant security awareness training. Eliminate shared accounts. Implement least privilege access. Encrypt sensitive data at rest. Deploy data loss prevention. Implement security monitoring with alerting. <break time='0.5s'/> This scenario shows how multiple control weaknesses chain together into a catastrophic breach.
