Network security controls protect data in motion and control access between systems. Let's cover the key technologies. <break time='1s'/> Firewalls are the primary network boundary control. They examine traffic and allow or deny based on rules. <break time='0.5s'/> Packet filtering firewalls examine headers: source and destination IP, port numbers, and protocol. They're fast but limited. They can't see inside the packet. <break time='0.5s'/> Stateful inspection firewalls track connection state. They understand that a response packet relates to an earlier request. More intelligent but still limited to headers. <break time='0.5s'/> Application layer firewalls, also called next-generation firewalls, inspect content. They can block specific applications, scan for malware, and enforce policies based on user identity. <break time='1s'/> Intrusion Detection Systems, or I.D.S., monitor traffic for malicious activity. They detect and alert but don't block. Think of them as security cameras. <break time='0.5s'/> Intrusion Prevention Systems, or I.P.S., detect and actively block threats. They sit inline and can drop malicious traffic in real time. <break time='0.5s'/> Detection methods include signature-based, which matches known attack patterns, and anomaly-based, which detects deviations from normal behavior. Signature-based has fewer false positives but misses new attacks. Anomaly-based catches new attacks but has more false positives. <break time='1s'/> Virtual Private Networks, or V.P.N.s, create encrypted tunnels over untrusted networks. Remote workers connect via V.P.N. to access corporate resources securely over the internet. Site-to-site V.P.N.s connect entire offices. <break time='0.8s'/> Network segmentation limits lateral movement. Instead of one flat network, you create zones. The payment processing zone can't reach the development zone. If attackers breach one zone, segmentation contains them. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit focus: Review firewall rules for appropriateness. Verify I.D.S./I.P.S. is monitored and alerts are investigated. Check V.P.N. configurations and access logs. Evaluate segmentation strategy.
