Understanding control types is fundamental to I.S. auditing. Controls are classified by when they operate relative to an incident. <break time='1s'/> Preventive controls stop incidents before they occur. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: Firewalls blocking malicious traffic. Access controls preventing unauthorized users from entering. Input validation rejecting invalid data. Security training preventing employees from falling for phishing. <break time='0.5s'/> Preventive controls are the first line of defense. They're ideal because they prevent harm entirely. But no preventive control is perfect, so we need other types. <break time='1s'/> Detective controls identify incidents that have occurred or are occurring. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: Security monitoring detecting unusual activity. Log review finding unauthorized access. Reconciliations identifying discrepancies. Audit trails recording who did what. <break time='0.5s'/> Detective controls assume prevention will sometimes fail. They minimize damage by identifying incidents quickly. The faster you detect, the less damage occurs. <break time='1s'/> Corrective controls address incidents after detection. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: Incident response procedures containing a breach. Backup restoration recovering lost data. Patches fixing vulnerabilities. Disciplinary actions addressing policy violations. <break time='0.5s'/> Corrective controls limit damage and restore normal operations. <break time='1s'/> Compensating controls substitute when primary controls can't be implemented. <break time='0.5s'/> Example: You can't implement multifactor authentication on a legacy system. As compensation, you implement enhanced monitoring, restrict network access, and require password changes every thirty days. Compensating controls should address the same risk, provide similar assurance, and not introduce new risks. <break time='1s'/> Exam application: When asked which control type is most effective, preventive is usually the answer because preventing harm is better than detecting or correcting it.
