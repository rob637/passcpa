The System Development Life Cycle, or SDLC, provides structure to building information systems. Auditors must understand each phase and its control objectives. <break time='1s'/> Phase one is planning and feasibility. <break time='0.5s'/> What problem are we solving? Is a new system the right solution? The business case documents the need, costs, benefits, and alternatives. A feasibility study assesses technical, economic, and operational feasibility. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Was proper analysis done? Were alternatives considered? Did appropriate management approve proceeding? <break time='1s'/> Phase two is requirements definition. <break time='0.5s'/> What must the system do? Gather requirements from stakeholders. Document functional requirements, which describe what the system does, and non-functional requirements, which describe how well it performs. Requirements should be specific, measurable, and testable. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Did business users participate? Are requirements documented and signed off? <break time='1s'/> Phase three is design. <break time='0.5s'/> How will the system work? Logical design describes what the system will do. Physical design describes the technical implementation. Design documents should trace back to requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Does design address all requirements? Were security and control requirements included from the start? <break time='1s'/> Phase four is development or acquisition. <break time='0.5s'/> Build or buy the system. For custom development, programmers write code following design specifications. For purchased software, you evaluate vendors and configure the package. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Were coding standards followed? Was a build-or-buy analysis conducted? <break time='1s'/> Phase five is testing. <break time='0.5s'/> Does the system work correctly? Multiple test types at multiple levels ensure quality. We covered testing types in a previous video. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Was testing adequate? Were defects tracked and resolved? <break time='1s'/> Phase six is implementation. <break time='0.5s'/> Deploy the system. Train users. Migrate data. Go live. Implementation approaches include parallel, where old and new run simultaneously; phased, where you deploy to groups over time; pilot, where you deploy to one location first; and big bang, where you cut over completely at once. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Was implementation properly approved? Were users trained? Was data migration verified? <break time='1s'/> Phase seven is operations and maintenance. <break time='0.5s'/> Run and support the system. Fix bugs. Apply patches. Enhance functionality over time. Most system costs occur in this phase. <break time='0.5s'/> Eventually, the system reaches end of life and is replaced, restarting the cycle.
