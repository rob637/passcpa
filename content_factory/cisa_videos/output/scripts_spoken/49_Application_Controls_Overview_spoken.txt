Application controls are embedded in business applications to ensure data integrity and proper processing. They complement general IT controls. <break time='1s'/> Application controls fall into three categories based on where they operate. <break time='0.8s'/> Input controls ensure data entering the system is accurate, complete, and authorized. <break time='0.5s'/> Data validation checks that data meets defined formats and rules. Is the date valid? Is the account number the right length? Is the quantity numeric? <break time='0.5s'/> Range checks verify values fall within acceptable limits. An hourly wage of one thousand dollars would fail a range check. <break time='0.5s'/> Reasonableness checks compare values to expected norms. An order for one million units might be questioned. <break time='0.5s'/> Authorization controls ensure only approved transactions enter the system. Transactions above certain amounts require additional approval. <break time='1s'/> Processing controls ensure data is processed accurately and completely. <break time='0.5s'/> Run-to-run totals track totals from one processing step to the next to ensure nothing is lost or added. <break time='0.5s'/> Control totals track hash totals, record counts, and financial totals through processing. <break time='0.5s'/> Exception reporting identifies items that couldn't be processed normally for manual review. <break time='1s'/> Output controls ensure results are accurate, complete, and distributed appropriately. <break time='0.5s'/> Report distribution lists define who receives what reports. <break time='0.5s'/> Output reconciliation compares totals to input and processing totals. <break time='0.5s'/> Report review requires users to review output for reasonableness. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Document the application. Identify key controls at each stage. Test that controls operate effectively. Trace transactions from input through processing to output.
