Systems must have adequate capacity to meet current and future demand. Performance management ensures they meet user expectations. <break time='1s'/> Capacity management has three sub-processes. <break time='0.8s'/> Business capacity management understands future business needs. If the company plans to double sales, systems need to handle double the transactions. <break time='0.8s'/> Service capacity management ensures services meet defined targets. Service level agreements might promise 99.9% availability and sub-second response time. <break time='0.8s'/> Component capacity management monitors infrastructure components: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk space, network bandwidth. <break time='1s'/> Capacity planning predicts future needs. Historical trends show how usage is growing. Business forecasts indicate planned changes. New projects will add workload. <break time='0.5s'/> The goal is to have adequate capacity before it's needed. Running out of capacity causes performance problems or outages. <break time='1s'/> Performance management focuses on meeting expectations. <break time='0.5s'/> Define performance targets in service level agreements. Monitor actual performance against targets. Investigate when performance degrades. Tune systems to improve performance. <break time='0.8s'/> Performance baselines establish normal behavior. You can't identify abnormal performance without knowing what's normal. Establish baselines, then monitor for deviations. <break time='1s'/> Audit focus areas: Are capacity planning processes defined? Is performance monitored against targets? When capacity issues occur, are they addressed proactively? Are there documented capacity forecasts? <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: No capacity planning process. Reactive rather than proactive management. No defined performance targets.
