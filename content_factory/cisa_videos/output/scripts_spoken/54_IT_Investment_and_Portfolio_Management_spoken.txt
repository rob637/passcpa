IT investments should create value. Portfolio management ensures the organization invests wisely across all IT initiatives. <break time='1s'/> Think of IT investments like a financial portfolio. You wouldn't put all your retirement savings into one risky stock. You diversify across risk levels and time horizons. <break time='0.5s'/> IT portfolios include: Projects under development. Applications in production. Infrastructure platforms. Services from vendors. Each has different characteristics and investment needs. <break time='1s'/> Investment evaluation should consider: <break time='0.5s'/> Strategic alignment: Does this support business objectives? <break time='0.5s'/> Value proposition: What benefits will it deliver? Can we quantify them? <break time='0.5s'/> Risk: What could go wrong? How likely? How severe? <break time='0.5s'/> Resource requirements: What will it cost in money, people, and time? <break time='0.5s'/> Dependencies: What does it depend on? What depends on it? <break time='1s'/> Common evaluation methods include: <break time='0.5s'/> Return on investment, or R.O.I.: Net benefit divided by cost. Expressed as a percentage. <break time='0.5s'/> Net present value, or N.P.V.: Future cash flows discounted to present value. Positive N.P.V. means the investment creates value. <break time='0.5s'/> Internal rate of return, or IRR: The discount rate at which N.P.V. equals zero. Compare to the organization's cost of capital. <break time='0.5s'/> Payback period: How long until the investment pays for itself. <break time='1s'/> Portfolio management balances the entire portfolio. Don't just evaluate individual projects. Consider: Are we overinvested in any one area? Is our risk profile appropriate? Do we have the right mix of quick wins and long-term investments? <break time='0.5s'/> Audit focus: Are investments evaluated consistently? Does the methodology include non-financial factors? Is the portfolio actively managed or just a collection of approved projects?
