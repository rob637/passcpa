Business Impact Analysis, or B.I.A., identifies critical business functions and the impact if they're disrupted. It's foundational to business continuity planning. <break time='1s'/> The B.I.A. answers several key questions: <break time='0.5s'/> What business functions are critical? <break time='0.5s'/> What resources do they depend on, including systems, people, facilities, and vendors? <break time='0.5s'/> What's the impact if they're unavailable, measured in financial, operational, regulatory, and reputational terms? <break time='0.5s'/> How quickly must they be recovered? <break time='1s'/> The B.I.A. process involves several steps. <break time='0.8s'/> Identify business functions and processes. What does the organization actually do? <break time='0.8s'/> Identify dependencies. What systems, data, people, and facilities does each function need? <break time='0.8s'/> Determine impact over time. Impact often increases with duration. Four hours down might be inconvenient. Four days down might be catastrophic. <break time='0.8s'/> Establish recovery priorities and objectives. <break time='1s'/> Key metrics coming from the B.I.A.: <break time='0.5s'/> Recovery Time Objective, or R.T.O.: How quickly must the function be restored? If R.T.O. is four hours, you need recovery capabilities that can achieve four hours. <break time='0.5s'/> Recovery Point Objective, or R.P.O.: How much data loss is acceptable? If R.P.O. is one hour, you need backups at least every hour. <break time='0.5s'/> Maximum Tolerable Downtime, or M.T.D.: The absolute maximum the organization can survive without the function. R.T.O. must be less than M.T.D.. <break time='1s'/> Audit considerations: Is a B.I.A. documented? Is it current? Did business owners participate? Do recovery capabilities match B.I.A. requirements? If R.T.O. is four hours but actual recovery capability is twelve hours, there's a gap. <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: B.I.A. doesn't exist or is outdated. Recovery objectives aren't defined. Recovery capabilities don't match stated objectives.
