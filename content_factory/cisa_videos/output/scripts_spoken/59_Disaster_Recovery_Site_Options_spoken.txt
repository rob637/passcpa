Choosing the right disaster recovery site involves balancing recovery speed against cost. Let's examine the options in detail. <break time='1s'/> Cold site provides basic facilities: power, cooling, network connectivity, and physical space. There's no equipment installed. After a disaster, you procure hardware, install systems, restore data, and configure applications. <break time='0.5s'/> RTO for cold sites is typically weeks. Cost is lowest because you're only paying for empty space. Use cold sites for non-critical systems or as a backup to other strategies. <break time='1s'/> Warm site has some infrastructure in place: servers, network equipment, maybe older hardware or reduced capacity. Software may be installed but not current. Data backups are available but not immediately ready. <break time='0.5s'/> RTO for warm sites is typically days. Cost is moderate. Warm sites balance cost and recovery speed for systems that aren't immediately critical but need reasonably quick recovery. <break time='1s'/> Hot site mirrors the production environment. Same hardware, same software, current configurations. Data is replicated continuously or very frequently. You can switch operations quickly. <break time='0.5s'/> RTO for hot sites can be hours or even minutes. Cost is highest because you're essentially running two data centers. Use hot sites for critical systems where downtime has severe impact. <break time='1s'/> Mobile sites are containerized data centers that can be transported to any location. They provide flexibility for organizations with multiple facilities or unique requirements. <break time='0.8s'/> Cloud-based recovery has changed the economics. You can maintain a standby environment in the cloud at lower cost than a physical hot site, then scale up during a disaster. <break time='0.5s'/> Key consideration: The site choice must match the RTO from your Business Impact Analysis. There's no point paying for a hot site if your RTO is two weeks. There's no point having a cold site if your RTO is four hours.
