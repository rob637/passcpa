Emerging technologies create new risks that auditors must understand. Let's examine key areas: cloud computing, mobile, IoT, and artificial intelligence. <break time='1s'/> Cloud computing shifts processing and data to third-party infrastructure. Risks include: <break time='0.5s'/> Data sovereignty: Where does your data physically reside? Does it cross borders? Different jurisdictions have different requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> Vendor dependence: What happens if the vendor fails or changes terms? Can you move to another provider? <break time='0.5s'/> Shared responsibility: Security is shared between you and the provider. Understand the boundaries. The provider secures the infrastructure. You secure your data and access. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit implications: You may not be able to audit the provider directly. Rely on third-party attestations like SOC reports. <break time='1s'/> Mobile devices introduce risks: <break time='0.5s'/> Data leakage: Corporate data on personal devices. What happens when an employee leaves? <break time='0.5s'/> Device diversity: Supporting multiple operating systems and versions. <break time='0.5s'/> Connection security: Devices connect from untrusted networks. <break time='0.5s'/> Controls include mobile device management, containerization to separate corporate and personal data, and remote wipe capability. <break time='1s'/> Internet of Things expands the attack surface dramatically. Devices may have weak security, no update mechanisms, and long lifespans. A compromised device can be a network entry point. <break time='0.5s'/> Controls include network segmentation, security requirements in procurement, and monitoring for anomalous behavior. <break time='1s'/> Artificial intelligence introduces unique risks: <break time='0.5s'/> Model bias: AI can perpetuate or amplify biases in training data. <break time='0.5s'/> Explainability: Can you explain why the AI made a decision? <break time='0.5s'/> Data dependency: AI needs massive data, raising privacy concerns. <break time='0.5s'/> Adversarial attacks: Inputs designed to fool the AI. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit focus: Understand how the technology is used, assess specific risks, and verify controls address those risks.
