People are often the weakest link and the strongest asset in security. Security awareness programs aim to make people an asset. <break time='1s'/> Security awareness creates a security-conscious culture. Everyone understands they have a role in protecting information. They recognize threats and know how to respond. <break time='0.8s'/> Awareness programs typically include: <break time='0.5s'/> New employee orientation covering security policies, acceptable use, and reporting procedures. <break time='0.5s'/> Annual refresher training reinforcing key concepts and updating on new threats. <break time='0.5s'/> Role-based training for positions with specific security responsibilities. <break time='0.5s'/> Targeted campaigns addressing current threats like phishing or ransomware. <break time='0.5s'/> Ongoing communication through newsletters, posters, and reminders. <break time='1s'/> Effective training goes beyond policy recitation. <break time='0.5s'/> Make it relevant: Show how threats apply to their actual jobs. <break time='0.5s'/> Make it practical: Teach specific behaviors, not abstract concepts. <break time='0.5s'/> Make it interactive: Simulations and exercises, not just presentations. <break time='0.5s'/> Make it measurable: Track completion and test comprehension. <break time='1s'/> Phishing simulations are particularly valuable. Send fake phishing emails and track who clicks. Those who click get additional training. The organization tracks improvement over time. <break time='0.8s'/> Audit approach: Review the awareness program. Is training mandatory? Is it current? Is completion tracked? Are results measured? Interview employees to assess actual awareness. Test whether they know what policies require. <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: Training is outdated. Completion isn't tracked. No measurement of effectiveness.
