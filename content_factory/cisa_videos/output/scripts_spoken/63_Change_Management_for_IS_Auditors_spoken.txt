Change management is one of the most frequently audited IT controls, and it appears constantly on the CISA exam. Let's master it. <break time='1s'/> The core principle: All changes to production systems should be requested, assessed, approved, tested, and documented before implementation. <break time='0.5s'/> Unauthorized changes introduce risk. They might contain errors that cause outages. They might introduce security vulnerabilities. They might conflict with other changes. They complicate troubleshooting when problems occur. <break time='1s'/> The change management process has key stages. <break time='0.8s'/> Change request: Someone submits a formal request describing what they want to change and why. <break time='0.8s'/> Impact assessment: Technical staff assess the risk, dependencies, and resources required. What could go wrong? What systems are affected? <break time='0.8s'/> Approval: An appropriate authority reviews and approves. For high-risk changes, this might be a Change Advisory Board. For routine changes, a manager might approve. <break time='0.8s'/> Testing: The change is tested in a non-production environment. Does it work? Does it break anything else? <break time='0.8s'/> Implementation: The change is deployed to production during an approved window. <break time='0.8s'/> Post-implementation review: Verify the change worked as expected. Close the change record. <break time='1s'/> What about emergencies? <break time='0.5s'/> Emergency changes are allowed, but they're not exemptions from control. The change should still be logged, approved by an authorized manager even if after hours, tested as much as possible, and documented. Retroactive review should occur within a defined timeframe. <break time='1s'/> As an auditor, you sample completed changes and trace them through the process. Did a request exist? Was it approved before implementation? Was testing performed? Is there documentation? <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: Changes implemented without approval, testing bypassed, documentation incomplete.
