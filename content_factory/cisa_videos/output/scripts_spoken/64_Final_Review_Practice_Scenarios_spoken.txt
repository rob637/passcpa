Let's walk through sample scenarios applying our framework. These will build your pattern recognition. <break time='1s'/> Scenario one: An organization experiences a data breach. During investigation, the IS auditor discovers that logs were overwritten and cannot be recovered. What should the auditor identify as the primary control weakness? <break time='0.5s'/> Think about it. Logs were overwritten, so we cannot investigate the breach fully. What's the control weakness? <break time='0.5s'/> Possible answers might include: inadequate log retention, lack of intrusion detection, insufficient access controls, missing data encryption. <break time='0.5s'/> The scenario specifically mentions logs were overwritten. The question asks about the primary control weakness given the facts presented. The answer is inadequate log retention. The other options might be true, but they're not supported by the scenario. <break time='1s'/> Scenario two: During a change management audit, you find that emergency changes bypass the normal approval process but are documented afterward. What should you conclude? <break time='0.5s'/> Emergency changes with retroactive documentation is actually an acceptable practice in most change management frameworks. The key is that changes are still documented and reviewed. <break time='0.5s'/> If an option says this is a significant control weakness, it's probably wrong. If an option says this is acceptable if documented and reviewed within a defined timeframe, that's likely correct. <break time='1s'/> Scenario three: Management asks the IS auditor to help implement a new control to address a finding from the previous audit. What should the auditor do? <break time='0.5s'/> This tests independence. Auditors should not implement controls because they would then audit their own work. <break time='0.5s'/> The answer would be to decline and explain that implementation would compromise independence, but offer to provide guidance on control objectives. <break time='1s'/> Pattern recognition: As you study, you'll notice the same themes recurring. Independence. Risk-based approach. Prioritization. Documentation. Control categories. Recognizing the theme helps you identify the right answer.
