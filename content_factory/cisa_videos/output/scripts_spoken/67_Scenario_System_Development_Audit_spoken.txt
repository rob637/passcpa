You're auditing a critical system development project six months before planned go-live. The project will replace the core billing system. What are you looking for? <break time='1s'/> You start with project documentation. <break time='0.5s'/> You review the project charter, which exists and shows proper authorization. <break time='0.5s'/> You review the requirements document. It's comprehensive, but you notice many requirements are marked TBD even though the project is past the requirements phase. Business users signed off, but the sign-off date was before many requirements were added. <break time='0.5s'/> The design document traces to requirements. Good. But some requirements don't have corresponding design elements. <break time='0.5s'/> The project plan shows aggressive timelines. Testing is scheduled for four weeks. The project manager says that's standard for projects this size, but you know the system is highly complex. <break time='1s'/> You interview stakeholders. <break time='0.5s'/> The project manager is confident but stressed. He mentions the deadline is firm because of a regulatory requirement. <break time='0.5s'/> The development lead says they're coding as fast as they can, but requirements keep changing. Change control exists but doesn't seem to slow changes down. <break time='0.5s'/> The testing lead is worried. She doesn't have enough testers, and she hasn't seen final requirements to develop test cases. <break time='0.5s'/> Business users say they're too busy with daily operations to participate much in the project. <break time='1s'/> You identify risks and control weaknesses. <break time='0.5s'/> Requirements instability this late suggests scope isn't controlled. <break time='0.5s'/> Testing appears inadequate given system complexity and timeline. <break time='0.5s'/> User involvement is insufficient, creating U.A.T. risk. <break time='0.5s'/> The aggressive timeline with a firm deadline creates pressure to cut corners. <break time='1s'/> You draft findings. You don't say the project will fail. You identify specific risks and recommend mitigating actions: Stabilize requirements and implement stronger change control. Increase testing resources and duration. Require dedicated business user participation. <break time='0.5s'/> Your audit adds value by identifying problems while there's still time to address them.
