The audit committee wants assurance that the organization can recover from a disaster. You're conducting a disaster recovery readiness assessment. <break time='1s'/> You start with documentation. <break time='0.5s'/> You request the Business Impact Analysis. It exists but was last updated three years ago. New systems have been implemented since then. <break time='0.5s'/> You request the disaster recovery plan. It's a thick document. Section by section, it appears comprehensive: recovery procedures, contact lists, resource requirements. But the version control shows no updates in eighteen months. <break time='0.5s'/> You request test results. The last test was a tabletop exercise fifteen months ago. Results showed several gaps. Follow-up actions were assigned but you see no evidence they were completed. <break time='1s'/> You examine recovery capabilities. <break time='0.5s'/> The organization has a contract with a D.R. provider for a warm site. You verify the contract is current. <break time='0.5s'/> Cloud systems are in a single availability zone. No cross-region replication exists. <break time='0.5s'/> Backup tapes are stored off-site, but restoration testing hasn't been performed in two years. <break time='1s'/> You conduct interviews. <break time='0.5s'/> IT management says D.R. is a priority but other initiatives took precedence. <break time='0.5s'/> The D.R. coordinator role is vacant. The previous coordinator left six months ago. <break time='0.5s'/> Staff are unsure of their recovery responsibilities. They think there's a plan somewhere but haven't seen it. <break time='1s'/> Your assessment is concerning. <break time='0.5s'/> The organization has D.R. documentation, but it's outdated. <break time='0.5s'/> Recovery capabilities haven't been verified. <break time='0.5s'/> Testing is insufficient and follow-through is lacking. <break time='0.5s'/> No one is driving the program since the coordinator left. <break time='1s'/> Recommendations: Assign D.R. program ownership immediately. Update the B.I.A. to reflect current systems. Revise the D.R. plan to address B.I.A. findings. Conduct a recovery test within ninety days. Establish an annual testing schedule. <break time='0.5s'/> You're providing the audit committee with an honest assessment: on paper it looks adequate, but dig deeper and there are gaps.
