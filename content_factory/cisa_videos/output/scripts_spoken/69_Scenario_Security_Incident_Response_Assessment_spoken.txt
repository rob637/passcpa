Following a ransomware attack at a competitor, management wants assurance that the organization can respond effectively to a security incident. You're assessing incident response readiness. <break time='1s'/> You request the incident response plan. A fifty-page document arrives. It defines incident categories, response procedures, roles and responsibilities, and communication protocols. On paper, it looks thorough. <break time='1s'/> You examine specific elements. <break time='0.5s'/> The plan defines an Incident Response Team with named members. You verify the team exists and members know their roles. Most do, though two positions have changed without updating the plan. <break time='0.5s'/> Contact information is in an appendix. Some numbers are outdated. The emergency contact for the C.E.O. is a number that's been disconnected for a year. <break time='0.5s'/> Communication templates exist for notifying customers, regulators, and media. Legal has reviewed them. Good. <break time='0.5s'/> The plan references forensics capabilities, but the organization doesn't have them internally. The plan says to call a forensics firm, but no contract exists. During an incident, you'd be negotiating terms while under attack. <break time='1s'/> You review past incidents. <break time='0.5s'/> There have been several minor incidents in the past year. Incident tickets exist. Response varied. Some incidents followed the plan. Others were handled informally. One significant incident was escalated appropriately and documented well. <break time='1s'/> You ask about testing. <break time='0.5s'/> The organization conducted a tabletop exercise two years ago. No exercises since. The exercise identified communication gaps that remain unaddressed. <break time='1s'/> Your findings: <break time='0.5s'/> A formal plan exists, which is positive. <break time='0.5s'/> The plan needs updating for personnel and contact changes. <break time='0.5s'/> Forensics capability should be formalized through retainer agreement. <break time='0.5s'/> Exercise frequency should increase to annual. <break time='0.5s'/> Plan should be socialized more broadly so all staff know basic procedures. <break time='1s'/> You conclude: Incident response capability is developing but not mature. With specific improvements, the organization can significantly strengthen its readiness.
