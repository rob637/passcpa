Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s'/> This video covers Data Classification and Handling <break time='0.3s'/> a foundational security concept you'll definitely see on exam day. <break time='1s'/> Data classification assigns sensitivity levels to information <break time='0.3s'/> determining who can access it and how it must be protected. <break time='1s'/> Most organizations use a tiered classification scheme. Common levels include <break time='0.3s'/> Public <break time='0.3s'/> Internal <break time='0.3s'/> Confidential <break time='0.3s'/> and Restricted or Secret. <break time='1s'/> Public data can be freely shared <break time='0.3s'/> like marketing materials. Internal data is for employees only <break time='0.3s'/> like policies and procedures. Confidential data requires specific authorization <break time='0.3s'/> like customer records. Restricted data has the highest protection <break time='0.3s'/> like trade secrets or personal health information. <break time='1s'/> Key exam concept <break time='0.3s'/> Data owners are responsible for classification decisions. They understand the business value and determine the appropriate level. Data custodians implement the technical controls to protect data at each level. <break time='1s'/> Handling procedures must align with classification <break time='0.3s'/> This includes storage requirements <break time='0.3s'/> encryption standards <break time='0.3s'/> transmission methods <break time='0.3s'/> and disposal procedures. Higher classifications require stronger controls throughout the data lifecycle. <break time='1s'/> Remember for the exam <break time='0.3s'/> Classification should be based on the highest sensitivity of any data element in a document <break time='0.3s'/> even if most content is public. And always consider regulatory requirements <break time='0.3s'/> some data types have legally mandated handling procedures. <break time='1s'/> That's data classification and handling <break time='0.3s'/> Know your classification levels <break time='0.3s'/> understand owner versus custodian roles <break time='0.3s'/> and match handling procedures to sensitivity. Good luck on exam day!
