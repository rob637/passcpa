Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s'/> Today we're covering Segregation of Duties in IT <break time='0.3s'/> a critical control concept that appears frequently on the CISA exam. <break time='1s'/> Segregation of Duties <break time='0.3s'/> or SoD <break time='0.3s'/> prevents any single person from having complete control over a critical process. The goal is to ensure that fraud or errors require collusion between multiple people <break time='0.3s'/> making them harder to commit and easier to detect. <break time='1s'/> In IT environments <break time='0.3s'/> key segregation includes separating development from production access <break time='0.3s'/> separating custody of assets from record keeping <break time='0.3s'/> and separating authorization from execution. <break time='1s'/> Classic IT segregation examples include <break time='0.3s'/> Programmers should not have access to production systems <break time='0.3s'/> Database administrators should not have access to source code <break time='0.3s'/> Security administrators should not perform system development <break time='0.3s'/> And operators should not modify programs. <break time='1s'/> In small IT shops where perfect segregation isn't possible <break time='0.3s'/> compensating controls become essential. These include detailed logging and monitoring <break time='0.3s'/> independent review of logs <break time='0.3s'/> supervisory oversight <break time='0.3s'/> and periodic reconciliations. <break time='1s'/> For the exam <break time='0.3s'/> remember that the auditor's role is to identify segregation weaknesses and recommend compensating controls when segregation isn't feasible. Also know that role-based access control supports SoD by limiting users to functions required for their job. <break time='1s'/> That's segregation of duties in IT <break time='0.3s'/> Separate critical functions <break time='0.3s'/> use compensating controls when needed <break time='0.3s'/> and always think collusion prevention. Good luck on exam day!
