Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s' /> This video covers Key Risk Indicators <break time='0.3s' /> also known as KRIs <break time='0.3s' /> essential metrics for IT risk monitoring.

<break time='1.0s' />

Key Risk Indicators are metrics that provide early warning signals about increasing risk exposure. They help management identify emerging risks before they become significant issues.

<break time='1.0s' />

KRIs differ from Key Performance Indicators or KPIs <break time='0.3s' /> KPIs measure how well objectives are being achieved <break time='0.3s' /> KRIs measure the likelihood of not achieving those objectives. Both are important <break time='0.3s' /> but KRIs focus specifically on risk.

<break time='0.8s' />

Examples of IT KRIs include <break time='0.3s' /> Number of unpatched critical vulnerabilities <break time='0.3s' /> Percentage of systems without current backups <break time='0.3s' /> Number of unauthorized access attempts <break time='0.3s' /> Staff turnover rate in key IT positions <break time='0.3s' /> And number of overdue audit findings.

<break time='1.0s' />

Effective KRIs have certain characteristics <break time='0.3s' /> They're measurable and quantifiable <break time='0.3s' /> They have defined thresholds that trigger action <break time='0.3s' /> They're predictive rather than reactive <break time='0.3s' /> And they align with the organization's risk appetite.

<break time='0.8s' />

For auditors <break time='0.3s' /> evaluate whether KRIs are defined for significant risks <break time='0.3s' /> whether thresholds are appropriate <break time='0.3s' /> whether KRIs are monitored regularly <break time='0.3s' /> and whether threshold breaches trigger management action.

<break time='0.8s' />

That's Key Risk Indicators <break time='0.3s' /> early warning metrics <break time='0.3s' /> threshold-based monitoring <break time='0.3s' /> and proactive risk management. Good luck on exam day!
