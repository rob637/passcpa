Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s'/> This video covers Key Risk Indicators <break time='0.3s'/> also known as K.R.I.s <break time='0.3s'/> essential metrics for IT risk monitoring. <break time='1s'/> Key Risk Indicators are metrics that provide early warning signals about increasing risk exposure. They help management identify emerging risks before they become significant issues. <break time='1s'/> K.R.I.s differ from Key Performance Indicators or K.P.I.s <break time='0.3s'/> K.P.I.s measure how well objectives are being achieved <break time='0.3s'/> K.R.I.s measure the likelihood of not achieving those objectives. Both are important <break time='0.3s'/> but K.R.I.s focus specifically on risk. <break time='1s'/> Examples of IT K.R.I.s include <break time='0.3s'/> Number of unpatched critical vulnerabilities <break time='0.3s'/> Percentage of systems without current backups <break time='0.3s'/> Number of unauthorized access attempts <break time='0.3s'/> Staff turnover rate in key IT positions <break time='0.3s'/> And number of overdue audit findings. <break time='1s'/> Effective K.R.I.s have certain characteristics <break time='0.3s'/> They're measurable and quantifiable <break time='0.3s'/> They have defined thresholds that trigger action <break time='0.3s'/> They're predictive rather than reactive <break time='0.3s'/> And they align with the organization's risk appetite. <break time='1s'/> For auditors <break time='0.3s'/> evaluate whether K.R.I.s are defined for significant risks <break time='0.3s'/> whether thresholds are appropriate <break time='0.3s'/> whether K.R.I.s are monitored regularly <break time='0.3s'/> and whether threshold breaches trigger management action. <break time='1s'/> That's Key Risk Indicators <break time='0.3s'/> early warning metrics <break time='0.3s'/> threshold-based monitoring <break time='0.3s'/> and proactive risk management. Good luck on exam day!
