Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s'/> This video covers Database Security and Controls <break time='0.3s'/> protecting the critical data stores that organizations depend on. <break time='1s'/> Databases contain an organization's most valuable information <break time='0.3s'/> customer data <break time='0.3s'/> financial records <break time='0.3s'/> intellectual property. Protecting them requires layered security controls. <break time='1s'/> Key database security controls include <break time='0.3s'/> Access controls that restrict who can view and modify data <break time='0.3s'/> Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit <break time='0.3s'/> Audit logging of all database activities <break time='0.3s'/> Input validation to prevent injection attacks <break time='0.3s'/> And regular backups with tested recovery procedures. <break time='1s'/> Database administrator or D.B.A. access requires special attention <break time='0.3s'/> DBAs typically have elevated privileges and can bypass application controls. Compensating controls include activity logging <break time='0.3s'/> separation of duties <break time='0.3s'/> and independent review of D.B.A. actions. <break time='1s'/> SQL injection is a critical threat to database security <break time='0.3s'/> Attackers insert malicious code through application inputs to manipulate queries. Prevention requires parameterized queries <break time='0.3s'/> input validation <break time='0.3s'/> and least privilege database accounts. <break time='1s'/> For auditors <break time='0.3s'/> verify that sensitive data is encrypted <break time='0.3s'/> access is granted based on least privilege <break time='0.3s'/> audit logs capture privileged activities <break time='0.3s'/> and applications use secure coding practices. <break time='1s'/> That's database security <break time='0.3s'/> access controls <break time='0.3s'/> encryption <break time='0.3s'/> logging <break time='0.3s'/> and injection prevention. Good luck on exam day!
