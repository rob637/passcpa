Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s'/> This video covers Cloud Computing Audit Considerations <break time='0.3s'/> essential knowledge as organizations increasingly move to the cloud. <break time='1s'/> Cloud computing shifts IT resources to third-party providers <break time='0.3s'/> This changes the risk landscape and requires new audit approaches. Auditors must understand shared responsibility models and cloud-specific risks. <break time='1s'/> The three main service models are <break time='0.3s'/> Infrastructure as a Service or I-A-A-S <break time='0.3s'/> where the provider manages hardware <break time='0.3s'/> Platform as a Service or P-A-A-S <break time='0.3s'/> where the provider also manages operating systems <break time='0.3s'/> And Software as a Service or S-A-A-S <break time='0.3s'/> where the provider manages everything except user data and access. <break time='1s'/> Key cloud audit considerations include <break time='0.3s'/> Data location and sovereignty <break time='0.3s'/> where is data stored and what laws apply <break time='0.3s'/> Vendor lock-in risk <break time='0.3s'/> can you move to another provider <break time='0.3s'/> Shared infrastructure <break time='0.3s'/> is there adequate isolation between tenants <break time='0.3s'/> And right to audit <break time='0.3s'/> can you or a third party examine provider controls. <break time='1s'/> S.O.C. reports are critical for cloud assurance <break time='0.3s'/> S.O.C. 2 Type 2 reports provide independent verification of provider controls. Review these reports for the services you use <break time='0.3s'/> checking coverage period <break time='0.3s'/> scope <break time='0.3s'/> and any exceptions noted. <break time='1s'/> Remember <break time='0.3s'/> outsourcing to the cloud doesn't outsource accountability. The organization remains responsible for data protection and regulatory compliance. <break time='1s'/> That's cloud computing audit <break time='0.3s'/> service models <break time='0.3s'/> shared responsibility <break time='0.3s'/> and third-party assurance. Good luck on exam day!
