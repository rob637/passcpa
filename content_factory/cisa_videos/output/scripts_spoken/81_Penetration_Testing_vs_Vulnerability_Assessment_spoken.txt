Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s'/> This video clarifies the difference between Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment <break time='0.3s'/> two security testing approaches that are frequently confused on the exam. <break time='1s'/> Vulnerability assessment identifies potential weaknesses in systems <break time='0.3s'/> It uses automated scanning tools to find known vulnerabilities <break time='0.3s'/> missing patches <break time='0.3s'/> and misconfigurations. It's typically non-intrusive and doesn't attempt to exploit findings. <break time='1s'/> Penetration testing goes further <break time='0.3s'/> It actively attempts to exploit vulnerabilities to determine actual risk. Pen testers simulate real attackers <break time='0.3s'/> chaining together vulnerabilities to see how far they can get. It's intrusive and requires careful scoping and authorization. <break time='1s'/> Key differences to remember <break time='0.3s'/> Vulnerability assessment is broad and automated <break time='0.3s'/> penetration testing is targeted and manual <break time='0.3s'/> Vulnerability assessment identifies potential issues <break time='0.3s'/> penetration testing proves exploitability <break time='0.3s'/> Vulnerability assessment is lower risk <break time='0.3s'/> penetration testing can disrupt systems. <break time='1s'/> Penetration testing types include <break time='0.3s'/> Black box where testers have no prior knowledge <break time='0.3s'/> White box where testers have full system documentation <break time='0.3s'/> And gray box which falls in between. <break time='1s'/> For auditors <break time='0.3s'/> verify that testing is authorized in writing <break time='0.3s'/> scope is clearly defined <break time='0.3s'/> testers are qualified <break time='0.3s'/> and findings lead to remediation. <break time='1s'/> That's vulnerability assessment versus penetration testing <break time='0.3s'/> scanning versus exploitation <break time='0.3s'/> automated versus manual. Good luck on exam day!
