IT strategy should drive IT decisions, and IT strategy should align with business strategy. Let's understand how strategic planning works. <break time='1s'/> Strategic planning operates at three levels. <break time='0.8s'/> Business strategy defines what the organization wants to achieve. Where will we compete? How will we win? What are our long-term objectives? <break time='0.8s'/> IT strategy defines how technology supports business strategy. What capabilities do we need? What platforms will we use? How will IT be organized? <break time='0.8s'/> Operational plans define tactical execution. What projects will we undertake? What resources do we need this year? What are our quarterly milestones? <break time='1s'/> Alignment means IT strategy derives from business strategy. If the business wants to expand globally, IT plans for global infrastructure. If the business wants to improve customer experience, IT invests in customer-facing technology. <break time='0.5s'/> Misalignment occurs when IT pursues technology for technology's sake or when business makes decisions without considering IT implications. <break time='1s'/> Key IT planning documents include: <break time='0.5s'/> IT strategic plan documenting three to five year direction, aligned with business strategy. <break time='0.5s'/> IT tactical plan covering one to three year initiatives, projects, and resource requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> IT operations plan covering current year budgets, staffing, and deliverables. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Obtain the IT strategic plan. Compare it to business strategy. Does IT address business needs? Do IT investments make sense given business direction? Review strategic planning processes. Does IT leadership participate in business planning? Does business leadership approve IT strategy? <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: No formal IT strategy exists. IT strategy doesn't reference business strategy. Plans are outdated.
