Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s'/> This video covers Software Licensing Compliance <break time='0.3s'/> an often overlooked but important audit area. <break time='1s'/> Software licensing compliance ensures organizations only use software they're legally entitled to use. Non-compliance creates legal <break time='0.3s'/> financial <break time='0.3s'/> and security risks. <break time='1s'/> Common license types include <break time='0.3s'/> Per-user licenses for individual users <break time='0.3s'/> Per-device licenses for specific machines <break time='0.3s'/> Concurrent licenses for a maximum number of simultaneous users <break time='0.3s'/> Site licenses for unlimited use at a location <break time='0.3s'/> And enterprise licenses covering the whole organization. <break time='1s'/> Compliance risks include <break time='0.3s'/> Using more copies than licensed <break time='0.3s'/> Using software beyond license scope <break time='0.3s'/> Failing to track license expirations <break time='0.3s'/> And using unlicensed or pirated software. <break time='1s'/> Software Asset Management or S.A.M. programs help maintain compliance <break time='0.3s'/> S.A.M. includes maintaining a software inventory <break time='0.3s'/> tracking licenses and entitlements <break time='0.3s'/> reconciling usage against licenses <break time='0.3s'/> and managing software requests and approvals. <break time='1s'/> For auditors <break time='0.3s'/> verify that a software inventory exists <break time='0.3s'/> that license documentation is maintained <break time='0.3s'/> that periodic reconciliations occur <break time='0.3s'/> and that unlicensed software is removed or licensed. <break time='1s'/> That's software licensing compliance <break time='0.3s'/> license types <break time='0.3s'/> compliance risks <break time='0.3s'/> and software asset management. Good luck on exam day!
