Welcome to Domain 1 of the CISA exam. I'm Marcus, and I've been conducting IS audits for over fifteen years. <break time='0.8s'/> This domain carries twenty-one percent of your exam score. That's roughly thirty-two questions. And here's what makes it special: <break time='0.5s'/> while the other domains test what you know about IT, this domain tests whether you know how to audit. <break time='1s'/> Think of Domain 1 as your auditor's toolkit. We'll cover the entire audit lifecycle, from that first planning meeting all the way through the final report. <break time='0.5s'/> You'll learn why we use risk-based auditing, how to gather evidence that actually holds up, and when to use statistical sampling versus judgmental sampling. <break time='0.8s'/> Here's a mental map for you. Domain 1 breaks into three big chunks. First: Planning. This is where you scope the audit, assess risks, and figure out what you're actually going to test. Second: Execution. This is fieldwork. You're gathering evidence, testing controls, documenting everything. Third: Reporting. You communicate findings, get management responses, and track remediation. <break time='1s'/> Now, why does ISACA weight this at twenty-one percent? Because you can memorize every IT control in existence, but if you don't know how to properly plan an audit, gather sufficient evidence, and communicate findings professionally, you're not ready to be a CISA. <break time='0.8s'/> The exam will test your judgment. They'll give you scenarios where you need to decide: What's the next step? What evidence is most reliable? When do you escalate? <break time='0.5s'/> As you work through the lessons and practice questions in this domain, keep asking yourself: What would a competent IS auditor do in this situation? <break time='0.8s'/> Let's build your audit foundation. See you in the next video where we'll break down the complete IS audit lifecycle.
