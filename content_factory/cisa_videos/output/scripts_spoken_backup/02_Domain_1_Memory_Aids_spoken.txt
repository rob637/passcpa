Let's lock in the key terms from Domain 1 with some memory tricks that will stick. <break time='0.5s'/> First up: the types of audit evidence. Remember: PAID. P for Physical observation. A for Analytical procedures. I for Inquiries and interviews. D for Documentation review. When the exam asks about evidence, think: have I been PAID? <break time='0.8s'/> Next: sampling. There are two types, and they rhyme. Statistical is mathematical. Judgmental is judgmental. Statistical sampling lets you project results to the whole population with measurable confidence. Judgmental relies on your professional expertise. Neither is wrong; they serve different purposes. <break time='0.8s'/> For audit risk, remember this formula: Audit Risk equals Inherent Risk times Control Risk times Detection Risk. The shortcut? A equals I times C times D. Or just remember: I Can Detect. Inherent, Control, Detection. <break time='0.5s'/> Finally, control testing. Compliance testing asks: Is the control being followed? Substantive testing asks: Are the numbers accurate? Think: Compliance is about Conformance. Substantive is about Substance, the actual data. <break time='0.8s'/> Quick review. PAID for evidence types. Statistical is mathematical. I Can Detect for audit risk. Compliance equals conformance, substantive equals substance. <break time='0.5s'/> These will come back to you when you need them most.
