Why do we use risk-based auditing? Because we can't audit everything. Resources are finite. Time is limited. So we focus our effort where it matters most. <break time='0.8s'/> Risk-based auditing means we direct our work toward the areas with the highest risk of material misstatement, fraud, or control failure. The higher the risk, the more testing we do. <break time='0.5s'/> Let me break down how this works in practice. <break time='1s'/> Step one: Identify the audit universe. What systems, processes, and controls could we audit? This is your full inventory. <break time='0.8s'/> Step two: Assess risk for each item. We look at inherent risk, which is the risk that exists before any controls. And we look at control risk, which is the risk that controls won't prevent or detect problems. We might also consider business impact. If this system fails, what's the damage? <break time='0.8s'/> Step three: Prioritize. High risk areas get more audit attention. Low risk areas get less, or maybe just a basic review. This becomes your audit plan. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's a common exam scenario: You have limited time and need to decide where to focus. The answer is almost always: focus on high-risk areas first. An item that's high impact and has weak controls should be at the top of your list. <break time='1s'/> Now, here's a nuance the exam tests. Risk assessment is not a one-time event. You should reassess risk continuously during the audit. If you discover something unexpected during fieldwork, you adjust your approach. <break time='0.8s'/> One more concept: audit risk. This is the risk that you, the auditor, will issue an incorrect opinion. You might say controls are effective when they're not. Audit risk has three components. Inherent risk and control risk are outside your control. But detection risk is within your control. You reduce detection risk by doing more testing, using better procedures, and applying professional skepticism. <break time='0.5s'/> The formula is: Audit Risk equals Inherent Risk times Control Risk times Detection Risk. Remember: I Can Detect.
