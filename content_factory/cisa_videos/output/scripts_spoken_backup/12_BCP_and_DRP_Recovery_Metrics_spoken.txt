Three metrics you absolutely must know for the exam: RTO, RPO, and MTD. Let's lock them in. <break time='0.8s'/> RPO: Recovery Point Objective. Ask yourself: How much data can I lose? RPO measures backward in time. If your RPO is four hours, you need backups at least every four hours. Losing more than four hours of data would be unacceptable. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: RPO looks backward. P for Past. Point in the past we can recover to. <break time='1s'/> RTO: Recovery Time Objective. Ask yourself: How fast must I recover? RTO measures forward from the disaster. If your RTO is four hours, you must have systems running again within four hours of the disruption. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: RTO looks forward. T for Time to recover. <break time='1s'/> MTD: Maximum Tolerable Downtime. Ask yourself: How long can the business survive? MTD is the absolute limit. Beyond MTD, the organization faces catastrophic consequences, potentially going out of business. <break time='0.5s'/> MTD should always be greater than RTO. If your MTD is eight hours, your RTO better be less than that. <break time='0.8s'/> Here's how they relate. RPO determines your backup strategy. RTO determines your recovery strategy. MTD determines your business continuity requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> Quick visual: Disaster strikes at time zero. RPO looks back, asking how much data we lost. RTO looks forward, asking how long until we're running. MTD is the absolute deadline. <break time='0.5s'/> One more phrase to remember: Point in the Past, Time to recover, Maximum Tolerable. RPO, RTO, MTD.
