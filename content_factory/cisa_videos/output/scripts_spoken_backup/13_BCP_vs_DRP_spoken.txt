Business Continuity Planning versus Disaster Recovery Planning. The exam expects you to know the difference. <break time='1s'/> Let's start with definitions. <break time='0.8s'/> Business Continuity Planning, BCP, focuses on keeping critical business functions operating during and after a disruption. It's business-focused. It's proactive. It asks: How do we keep serving customers even when something goes wrong? <break time='0.8s'/> Disaster Recovery Planning, DRP, focuses on restoring IT systems and data after a disruption. It's technology-focused. It's reactive. It asks: How do we get our systems back up after they go down? <break time='1s'/> Think of it this way: BCP keeps the business running. DRP brings IT back. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's a scenario to make it concrete. A fire destroys your main office. <break time='0.5s'/> BCP determines: Where do employees work? How do we answer customer calls? How do we process orders? It might involve alternate work locations, cross-trained staff, and manual workarounds. <break time='0.5s'/> DRP determines: How do we restore email? How do we recover the database? How do we reconnect to the network? It involves backup restoration, alternate data centers, and system failover. <break time='1s'/> Key exam point: BCP is broader. DRP is a subset of BCP. You need both, but business continuity is the bigger picture. <break time='0.8s'/> Another distinction: Scope. BCP covers the whole organization, including people, processes, facilities, and technology. DRP primarily covers technology and data. <break time='0.8s'/> Who's responsible? BCP is owned by business leadership, often through a steering committee. DRP is owned by IT, typically the CIO or IT director. But both require executive sponsorship. <break time='0.5s'/> One more exam trap: They might describe a plan and ask you to identify it. If it's about maintaining business operations, it's BCP. If it's specifically about restoring IT infrastructure, it's DRP.
