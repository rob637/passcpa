Welcome to Domain 5: Protection of Information Assets. I'm Nicole, and security is my specialty. <break time='0.8s'/> This is the big one. At twenty-seven percent, Domain 5 is the largest on the exam. That's roughly forty questions. If you want to pass the CISA, you need to own this domain. <break time='1s'/> The fundamental question here is simple but profound: Is the organization adequately protecting its information and information systems from threats? <break time='0.8s'/> Let me give you the layout. Domain 5 covers six major areas. <break time='0.5s'/> First: Information Security Governance and Management. How does the organization define, implement, and maintain security? What policies exist? Who's accountable? <break time='0.8s'/> Second: Access Controls. This is huge on the exam. Who can access what? How is identity verified? How are permissions assigned and managed? <break time='0.8s'/> Third: Network Security. Firewalls, intrusion detection, network segmentation, VPNs, wireless security. How does the organization protect its network perimeter and internal communications? <break time='0.8s'/> Fourth: Cryptography. Encryption, hashing, digital signatures, PKI. You need to understand how cryptography protects data and enables authentication. <break time='0.8s'/> Fifth: Security Operations. Vulnerability management, security monitoring, incident response. How does the organization detect and respond to threats? <break time='0.8s'/> Sixth: Physical and Environmental Security. Not everything is cyber. Facilities, data centers, equipment protection, and environmental controls are all in scope. <break time='1s'/> The exam will test your understanding of control types: preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, compensating. Know what each type does and recognize them in scenarios. <break time='0.8s'/> From an IS auditor's perspective, we're assessing whether security controls are properly designed, appropriately implemented, and effectively operating. We look at policies, we test technical controls, we evaluate security awareness, and we review incident handling. <break time='0.5s'/> This domain is comprehensive, but I'll make sure you're ready. Let's secure that passing score.
