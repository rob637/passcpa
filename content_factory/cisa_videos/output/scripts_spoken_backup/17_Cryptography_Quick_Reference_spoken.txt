Cryptography can feel overwhelming, but you only need to know a handful of concepts for the exam. Let's simplify. <break time='0.8s'/> Two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. <break time='0.5s'/> Symmetric uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. Think: Same key, Symmetric starts with S, Same starts with S. Fast, efficient, but you have the key distribution problem. How do you securely share the key? <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: AES, DES, 3DES. <break time='1s'/> Asymmetric uses two different keys: a public key and a private key. What one encrypts, only the other can decrypt. Solves the key distribution problem because you can share the public key freely. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: RSA, ECC. <break time='0.8s'/> When do you use each? Symmetric for encrypting large amounts of data because it's fast. Asymmetric for key exchange and digital signatures because it solves the trust problem. Many systems use both: asymmetric to exchange a symmetric key, then symmetric for the actual data. <break time='1s'/> Hashing is different from encryption. A hash is a one-way function. You can hash data but you can't unhash it. Used to verify integrity, not confidentiality. If even one bit changes, the hash changes completely. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: SHA-256, MD5 (though MD5 is deprecated). <break time='1s'/> Digital signatures combine hashing and asymmetric cryptography. You hash the message, then encrypt the hash with your private key. Recipients decrypt with your public key and compare hashes. This proves authenticity and integrity. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: A signature is personal, so you use your private key to create it.
