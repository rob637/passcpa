Waterfall and Agile are fundamentally different development approaches, and they require different audit strategies. Let's understand both. <break time='1s'/> Waterfall is sequential. Requirements are gathered upfront, then design, then development, then testing, then implementation. Each phase completes before the next begins. Documentation is extensive. Change is expensive. <break time='0.8s'/> Agile is iterative. Work happens in short cycles called sprints, typically two to four weeks. Requirements emerge and evolve. Working software is delivered frequently. Change is embraced. <break time='1s'/> From an audit perspective, each approach has different risks. <break time='0.8s'/> Waterfall risks: Requirements might be wrong because they were locked in too early. Testing might be rushed because development took too long. There's a big bang implementation that could fail catastrophically. <break time='0.8s'/> Agile risks: Documentation might be inadequate because the focus is on working software over comprehensive documentation. Changes might not be properly controlled because the methodology embraces change. User stories might lack sufficient detail for compliance requirements. <break time='1s'/> How do you audit each? <break time='0.5s'/> For Waterfall, you review phase gate approvals, design documents, and test plans. You verify that each phase was properly completed and approved before proceeding. <break time='0.5s'/> For Agile, you review the product backlog, sprint ceremonies, and definition of done. You verify that user stories include security and compliance requirements, that testing occurs each sprint, and that changes are still controlled even if rapid. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam point: Don't assume Agile means no controls. Good Agile still has controls. They're just embedded in the process differently. Security requirements should be in user stories. Testing happens continuously. Change control is through backlog management and sprint planning.
