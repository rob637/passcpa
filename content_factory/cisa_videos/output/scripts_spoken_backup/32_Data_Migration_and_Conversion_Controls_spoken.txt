Moving data from an old system to a new system is risky. Without proper controls, you can lose data, corrupt data, or end up with two versions of the truth. <break time='1s'/> Why is migration risky? <break time='0.5s'/> Data formats might differ between systems. A field that was thirty characters becomes twenty. Data gets truncated. <break time='0.5s'/> Business rules might differ. The old system allowed certain values that the new system rejects. <break time='0.5s'/> Data volumes are large. A single error in the migration script could affect millions of records. <break time='0.5s'/> Timing is critical. During migration, which system is the source of truth? <break time='1s'/> What controls should exist? <break time='0.8s'/> Data mapping documentation. Every field in the old system should map to a field in the new system, with transformation rules documented. <break time='0.8s'/> Data cleansing before migration. Clean up bad data in the old system before migrating. Garbage in, garbage out. <break time='0.8s'/> Migration testing. Run the migration in a test environment. Verify record counts, validate data values, and check edge cases. <break time='0.8s'/> Reconciliation after migration. Compare totals, samples, and critical records between old and new systems. Do the numbers match? <break time='0.8s'/> Rollback plan. What if migration fails? Can you restore the old system and try again? <break time='1s'/> Exam application: A question describes data discrepancies after a system migration. What control was likely missing? Data reconciliation. The organization should have verified that the data migrated completely and accurately before decommissioning the old system.
