IT operations keeps everything running day to day. As auditors, we need to understand the key control areas that prevent operational failures. <break time='1s'/> Let's cover the major areas. <break time='0.8s'/> Data center controls: Physical security limits access to authorized personnel. Environmental controls manage temperature, humidity, and fire suppression. Power redundancy through UPS and generators prevents outages during power failures. <break time='0.8s'/> Job scheduling: Batch processes run according to defined schedules. Job scheduling software manages dependencies between jobs. What happens if a job fails? There should be automated alerts and documented restart procedures. <break time='0.8s'/> Operator procedures: Documented procedures exist for routine tasks and exception handling. Operators shouldn't be making it up as they go. <break time='0.8s'/> Monitoring: Systems are continuously monitored for availability, performance, and capacity. Alerts trigger when thresholds are exceeded. Someone responds to those alerts. <break time='1s'/> Segregation of duties in operations is critical. <break time='0.5s'/> Operators should not have access to make unauthorized program changes. Developers should not have unsupervised access to production. System administrators should not process business transactions. <break time='0.5s'/> These separations prevent a single person from introducing errors or committing fraud undetected. <break time='1s'/> Common audit findings in operations: Excessive access privileges, typically everyone is an administrator. Alert fatigue where too many alerts leads to important ones being ignored. Undocumented manual processes where critical steps live in one person's head. Configuration drift where production systems differ from documented standards. <break time='0.5s'/> Your role as auditor: verify that documented procedures exist, are current, and are followed.
