Cybersecurity gets all the attention, but physical security failures can be just as devastating. If someone can walk into your data center, all your network security is irrelevant. <break time='1s'/> Let's cover the layers of physical security. <break time='0.8s'/> Perimeter security: This is the outer boundary. Fencing, walls, security guards, vehicle barriers. The goal is deterrence and delay. Make it hard to get close to the building. <break time='0.8s'/> Building access: Locked doors, access card readers, visitor management. Only authorized personnel should enter. Visitors should be logged and escorted. <break time='0.8s'/> Data center access: Within the building, the data center has additional restrictions. Separate access controls, possibly biometric authentication, mantrap entries that prevent tailgating, and video surveillance. <break time='0.8s'/> Rack and device access: High-security environments may lock individual racks. Console access to servers is controlled separately from remote access. <break time='1s'/> Environmental controls protect against non-human threats. <break time='0.5s'/> Temperature and humidity: Servers generate heat. Precision cooling systems maintain optimal conditions. Humidity must be controlled because too low causes static discharge and too high causes condensation. <break time='0.5s'/> Fire suppression: Data centers use clean agent suppression systems that don't damage equipment, unlike water sprinklers. Detection systems include smoke detectors and very early smoke detection apparatus, or VESDA. <break time='0.5s'/> Water detection: Sensors detect leaks before flooding occurs. <break time='0.5s'/> Power protection: Uninterruptible power supplies handle brief outages. Generators provide extended backup power. Power conditioning protects against surges and sags. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Tour the facility. Observe controls in action. Test access controls. Review visitor logs. Verify environmental monitoring. Check maintenance records for fire suppression systems.
