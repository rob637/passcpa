Defense in depth is the fundamental architecture of information security. If one control fails, others still protect you. No single point of failure. <break time='1s'/> Think of it like a castle. Multiple walls, a moat, guards, and a keep. Attackers have to breach multiple defenses. Each layer slows them down and provides detection opportunities. <break time='0.8s'/> In information security, we implement multiple layers. <break time='0.8s'/> Network perimeter: Firewalls filter traffic between networks. Intrusion prevention systems block known attack patterns. Demilitarized zones isolate public-facing services. <break time='0.8s'/> Network interior: Segmentation limits lateral movement. Internal firewalls protect sensitive zones. Network monitoring detects anomalies. <break time='0.8s'/> Host layer: Operating system hardening removes unnecessary services. Endpoint protection detects malware. Application whitelisting limits what can execute. <break time='0.8s'/> Application layer: Secure coding practices prevent vulnerabilities. Input validation stops injection attacks. Authentication and authorization control access. <break time='0.8s'/> Data layer: Encryption protects data at rest and in transit. Access controls limit who can see what. Data loss prevention monitors for exfiltration. <break time='1s'/> People layer: Security awareness training reduces human error. Policies establish expectations. Background checks verify trust. <break time='1s'/> A sophisticated attacker might bypass one layer. Maybe they phish an employee and get credentials to bypass network controls. But they still face internal segmentation, endpoint protection, application controls, and data encryption. <break time='0.5s'/> Exam tip: When evaluating controls, consider what happens if each one fails. Are there other controls that compensate? Defense in depth means yes.
