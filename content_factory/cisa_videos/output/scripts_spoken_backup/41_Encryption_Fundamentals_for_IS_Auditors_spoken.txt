Encryption appears constantly on the CISA exam. Let's build a solid foundation. <break time='1s'/> Encryption transforms readable data, called plaintext, into unreadable data, called ciphertext, using a key and an algorithm. Only someone with the correct key can decrypt back to plaintext. <break time='0.8s'/> There are two fundamental types of encryption. <break time='1s'/> Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It's fast and efficient. Examples include AES, which is the current standard, and older algorithms like DES and 3DES. <break time='0.5s'/> The challenge: How do you securely share the key? If you send the key over the same channel as the encrypted data, an attacker could intercept both. <break time='1s'/> Asymmetric encryption uses a key pair: a public key and a private key. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. You can freely share your public key. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples include RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. Asymmetric encryption is slower but solves the key distribution problem. <break time='1s'/> In practice, systems often combine both. Asymmetric encryption securely exchanges a symmetric key, then symmetric encryption handles the actual data because it's faster. This is called hybrid encryption and it's how HTTPS works. <break time='1s'/> Hash functions are related but different. A hash takes any input and produces a fixed-size output called a digest. It's one-way. You can't reverse a hash to get the original input. <break time='0.5s'/> Hashes verify integrity. If you hash a file and later hash it again, the same output means the file hasn't changed. Different output means something changed. <break time='0.5s'/> Common hash algorithms: SHA-256 is current best practice. MD5 and SHA-1 are deprecated due to collision vulnerabilities. <break time='1s'/> Exam application: Know that symmetric is faster, asymmetric solves key exchange, and hashing ensures integrity. Know the current standards: AES for symmetric, RSA or ECC for asymmetric, SHA-256 for hashing.
