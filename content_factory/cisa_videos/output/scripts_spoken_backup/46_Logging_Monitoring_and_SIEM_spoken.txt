If you can't see what's happening, you can't protect it. Logging and monitoring are foundational security controls. <break time='1s'/> What should be logged? <break time='0.5s'/> Authentication events: successful and failed logins, password changes, account lockouts. <break time='0.5s'/> Authorization events: access granted, access denied, privilege changes. <break time='0.5s'/> System events: startup, shutdown, configuration changes, errors. <break time='0.5s'/> Application events: transactions processed, data accessed, errors encountered. <break time='0.5s'/> Security events: firewall blocks, malware detections, intrusion alerts. <break time='1s'/> Logs must be protected. Attackers often try to modify or delete logs to cover their tracks. Store logs on separate systems. Use write-once media or append-only configurations. Implement access controls so only security personnel can access logs. <break time='1s'/> Retention matters. How long do you keep logs? Regulatory requirements may mandate minimum periods. Investigation needs require enough history to trace an incident. Common retention periods range from 90 days to seven years depending on log type and requirements. <break time='1s'/> SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. A SIEM collects logs from across the environment, normalizes them into a common format, correlates events across sources, and generates alerts based on rules. <break time='0.5s'/> For example, twenty failed logins on different systems from the same source IP within one minute triggers an alert for potential brute force attack. Neither log alone shows the pattern. The SIEM sees it by correlating events. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Verify logging is enabled and covers required events. Check log retention meets requirements. Confirm logs are protected from tampering. Review SIEM alert rules and response procedures.
