Auditors don't have unlimited time and resources. Risk assessment helps us focus on what matters most. Let's examine the methodologies. <break time='1s'/> Risk assessment fundamentally involves identifying threats, assessing vulnerabilities, evaluating potential impact, and determining likelihood. <break time='0.8s'/> Qualitative risk assessment describes risk in terms like high, medium, and low. It relies on expert judgment rather than precise calculations. <break time='0.5s'/> You gather stakeholders, discuss threats, and agree on ratings. It's faster and doesn't require precise data. But it's subjective. Two people might rate the same risk differently. <break time='0.8s'/> Quantitative risk assessment assigns numerical values. It calculates risk in dollar terms. <break time='0.5s'/> Key formulas: Single Loss Expectancy, or SLE, equals asset value times exposure factor. If a server worth $100,000 is fifty percent damaged, SLE is $50,000. <break time='0.5s'/> Annual Loss Expectancy, or ALE, equals SLE times annualized rate of occurrence. If that loss happens on average once every five years, that's 0.2 annually. ALE equals $50,000 times 0.2, which is $10,000 per year. <break time='0.5s'/> Quantitative is objective and enables cost-benefit analysis. But it requires data that may not exist. How often will a new threat occur? What's the precise impact? <break time='1s'/> Most organizations use a hybrid approach. Qualitative for initial screening, quantitative for significant risks where data exists. <break time='1s'/> For audit planning, risk assessment determines where to focus. High-risk areas get more attention: more testing, more detailed procedures. Low-risk areas get less attention or might be excluded. <break time='0.5s'/> The audit risk model, which we covered earlier, builds on this. Inherent risk captures the natural risk level. Control risk captures how well controls mitigate that risk. Together they determine required audit effort. <break time='0.5s'/> Document your risk assessment. Your conclusions should be supportable. Another qualified auditor should reach similar conclusions given the same information.
