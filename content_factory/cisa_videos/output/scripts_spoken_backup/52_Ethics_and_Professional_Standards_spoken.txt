IS auditors wield significant power. We access sensitive information. Our reports influence decisions. Professional ethics ensure we use that power responsibly. <break time='1s'/> ISACA's Code of Professional Ethics establishes foundational principles. <break time='0.8s'/> Support the implementation of appropriate standards and procedures for information systems. <break time='0.8s'/> Serve in the interest of stakeholders in a lawful manner while maintaining high standards of conduct. <break time='0.8s'/> Maintain privacy and confidentiality of information obtained during duties. <break time='0.8s'/> Maintain competency in respective fields and undertake only those activities for which you're qualified. <break time='0.8s'/> Inform appropriate parties of audit results. <break time='0.8s'/> Support professional education of stakeholders to enhance their understanding of information security and control. <break time='1s'/> Independence is crucial. Auditors must be free from conflicts of interest that might compromise judgment. You shouldn't audit systems you designed, departments where you have personal relationships, or areas where you have financial interests. <break time='0.5s'/> Even the appearance of conflict matters. If others could reasonably question your objectivity, there's a problem, even if you personally remain objective. <break time='1s'/> Confidentiality extends beyond the engagement. Information obtained during an audit cannot be used for personal benefit or disclosed inappropriately. This continues after the engagement ends and even after leaving the organization. <break time='1s'/> Professional skepticism means maintaining questioning mind. Don't accept representations without corroboration. Verify claims. Consider what might be wrong. <break time='0.5s'/> But professional skepticism doesn't mean distrust. It means healthy verification. Trust, but verify.
