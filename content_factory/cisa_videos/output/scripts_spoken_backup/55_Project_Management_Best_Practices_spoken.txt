Projects fail when management fails. Understanding project management helps auditors identify risks and control weaknesses. <break time='1s'/> Project management encompasses initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing projects. Each phase has key activities. <break time='0.8s'/> Initiation establishes the project. The project charter formally authorizes the project, names the project manager, and establishes initial scope and constraints. Without proper initiation, projects lack clear authority and boundaries. <break time='0.8s'/> Planning defines how work will be accomplished. The project plan includes scope statement, work breakdown structure, schedule, budget, resource plan, risk plan, quality plan, and communication plan. Inadequate planning is a primary cause of project failure. <break time='0.8s'/> Execution does the work. The project manager directs the team, manages stakeholders, and ensures work follows the plan. Most project effort occurs here. <break time='0.8s'/> Monitoring and control tracks progress and makes corrections. Compare actual to planned. Identify variances. Take corrective action. Report status to stakeholders. <break time='0.8s'/> Closing formalizes completion. Obtain formal acceptance. Transfer deliverables. Document lessons learned. Release resources. <break time='1s'/> Common project risks that auditors should watch for: <break time='0.5s'/> Scope creep: Requirements keep expanding without adjusting schedule and budget. <break time='0.5s'/> Unrealistic schedules: Deadlines set without regard to work required. <break time='0.5s'/> Resource constraints: Key people unavailable or overallocated. <break time='0.5s'/> Poor communication: Stakeholders don't know what's happening. <break time='0.5s'/> Inadequate testing: Quality sacrificed to meet deadlines. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Review project documentation. Interview key stakeholders. Assess whether controls are adequate given project risk. Look for warning signs like chronically missed milestones, frequent scope changes, or team turnover.
