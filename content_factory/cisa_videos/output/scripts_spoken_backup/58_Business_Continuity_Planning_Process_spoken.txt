Business Continuity Planning ensures the organization can continue critical operations during and after a disaster. It builds on the Business Impact Analysis. <break time='1s'/> The BCP lifecycle has several phases. <break time='0.8s'/> Initiation: Establish the BCP program. Obtain management commitment. Define scope and objectives. Assign responsibilities. <break time='0.8s'/> Business Impact Analysis: We covered this in the previous video. Identify critical functions and recovery requirements. <break time='0.8s'/> Strategy development: Determine how you'll achieve recovery objectives. Options include alternate sites, redundant systems, workarounds, and agreements with third parties. Select strategies that meet RTO and RPO at acceptable cost. <break time='0.8s'/> Plan development: Document detailed procedures. Who does what? In what sequence? What resources are needed? Plans should be actionable during a high-stress situation. <break time='0.8s'/> Testing: Verify plans actually work. Testing ranges from tabletop exercises to full-scale drills. Start simple and progress to more complex tests. <break time='0.8s'/> Maintenance: Keep plans current. Review after organizational changes. Update contact information. Incorporate lessons from tests and actual events. <break time='1s'/> Recovery site options range by capability and cost: <break time='0.5s'/> Hot site: Fully equipped and ready. Data replicated continuously. Can be operational in hours. Most expensive. <break time='0.5s'/> Warm site: Partially equipped. Needs some setup. Operational in days. Moderate cost. <break time='0.5s'/> Cold site: Empty facility with basic infrastructure. Needs everything installed. Operational in weeks. Least expensive. <break time='0.5s'/> The choice depends on RTO. If you need recovery in four hours, you need a hot site. <break time='1s'/> Testing types: <break time='0.5s'/> Checklist review: Participants review plans for completeness. <break time='0.5s'/> Tabletop exercise: Walk through a scenario verbally. <break time='0.5s'/> Simulation: Simulate a disaster without activating recovery. <break time='0.5s'/> Parallel test: Process at the recovery site while primary remains operational. <break time='0.5s'/> Full interruption: Actually switch operations to the recovery site. Highest risk, highest assurance. <break time='0.5s'/> Test annually at minimum. Document results. Fix identified gaps.
