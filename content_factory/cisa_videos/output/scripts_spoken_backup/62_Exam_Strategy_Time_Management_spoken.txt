You have four hours for one hundred fifty questions. That's ninety-six seconds per question. Let's develop a time management strategy. <break time='1s'/> First principle: Don't spend too much time on any single question. If you don't know the answer after reading it twice and eliminating options, mark it for review and move on. <break time='0.5s'/> You can always come back. An unanswered difficult question is the same as a wrong answer, but it cost you time that could have earned points on easier questions. <break time='1s'/> Recommended approach: <break time='0.5s'/> First pass: Answer questions you know confidently. Skip questions that require significant thought. Your goal is to bank easy points quickly. <break time='0.5s'/> Second pass: Return to skipped questions. Apply elimination strategies. Make educated guesses if needed. <break time='0.5s'/> Final review: Check flagged questions one more time. Verify you haven't missed any questions. <break time='1s'/> Time checkpoints help ensure you stay on pace. <break time='0.5s'/> After 50 questions: You should have used about 80 minutes. If you've used less, you're doing well. If you've used more, speed up. <break time='0.5s'/> After 100 questions: You should have used about 160 minutes. You have roughly an hour remaining for the last 50 questions and your final review. <break time='1s'/> On specific question types: <break time='0.5s'/> Straightforward knowledge questions should take 30 to 60 seconds. <break time='0.5s'/> Scenario questions with long stems take longer to read but the actual question is often straightforward. Read the question first to know what you're looking for. <break time='0.5s'/> Best answer questions where multiple options seem correct require more thought. Identify what makes one option better. <break time='0.5s'/> Don't change answers unless you have a clear reason. Your first instinct is usually correct.
