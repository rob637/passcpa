The CEO asks you to assess the maturity of IT governance in the organization. She wants to know where they stand and what they should improve. Here's how you approach it. <break time='1s'/> You start by establishing criteria. What does good IT governance look like? You reference frameworks like COBIT. Key areas include strategic alignment, value delivery, risk management, resource management, and performance measurement. <break time='0.5s'/> You'll use a maturity model. Level zero means nonexistent. Level one means initial or ad hoc. Level two means repeatable but intuitive. Level three means defined processes. Level four means managed and measurable. Level five means optimized. <break time='1s'/> You gather evidence across governance domains. <break time='0.8s'/> For strategic alignment, you look for: Is there an IT strategy? Does it align with business strategy? Does IT leadership participate in business planning? You find there's an IT strategy document, but it's three years old and doesn't reference current business initiatives. You rate this as level two. <break time='0.8s'/> For value delivery, you look for: Are investments evaluated consistently? Is value measured? You find projects are approved ad hoc without consistent criteria. Benefits are rarely tracked after implementation. You rate this as level one. <break time='0.8s'/> For risk management, you look for: Is IT risk in the enterprise risk framework? Are risks assessed regularly? You find IT risk is assessed annually and reported to the board, but risk appetite isn't formally defined. You rate this as level three. <break time='0.8s'/> For resource management, you look for: Is there capacity planning? Are skills managed? You find budget is managed, but human resource planning is reactive. You rate this as level two. <break time='0.8s'/> For performance measurement, you look for: Are there defined metrics? Are they monitored and reported? You find basic operational metrics exist but strategic outcome metrics don't. You rate this as level two. <break time='1s'/> You present findings: Overall governance maturity is level two, repeatable but intuitive. Strengths are in risk management. Weaknesses are in value delivery and strategic alignment. <break time='0.5s'/> Recommendations: Update the IT strategy with explicit business linkage. Implement consistent project evaluation criteria. Define and track benefit realization. Establish strategic performance metrics. <break time='0.5s'/> You've provided the CEO with a clear picture and a roadmap for improvement.
