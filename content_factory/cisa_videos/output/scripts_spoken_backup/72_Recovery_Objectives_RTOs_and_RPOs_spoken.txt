Recovery objectives appear constantly. Let's cement them. <break time='0.8s'/> RTO: Recovery Time Objective. How fast must you recover? <break time='0.5s'/> Think T for Time. RTO equals Time to recover. If RTO is four hours, the system must be operational within four hours. <break time='0.8s'/> RPO: Recovery Point Objective. How much data can you lose? <break time='0.5s'/> Think P for Point in time. RPO is how far back you go. If RPO is one hour, you can lose up to one hour of data. Backups must occur at least every hour. <break time='0.8s'/> MTD: Maximum Tolerable Downtime. The absolute limit. <break time='0.5s'/> Think M for Maximum. Beyond MTD, the business fails. MTD must be greater than RTO, otherwise your recovery target is impossible. <break time='0.8s'/> Quick math example: <break time='0.5s'/> Business says payroll must be recovered within 24 hours. That's RTO. <break time='0.5s'/> Business says they can recreate one day of transactions. That's RPO. <break time='0.5s'/> Business says without payroll for more than 48 hours, employees leave. That's MTD. <break time='0.8s'/> Recovery capabilities must meet objectives. <break time='0.5s'/> If RTO is four hours, you need a hot site, not a cold site. <break time='0.5s'/> If RPO is one hour, you need hourly backups or real-time replication. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam pattern: Scenario gives recovery requirements. You identify whether capabilities meet them. If RTO is four hours but recovery takes twelve, that's a gap.
