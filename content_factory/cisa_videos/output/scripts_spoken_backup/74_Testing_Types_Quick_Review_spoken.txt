Testing types show up constantly. Let's lock them in. <break time='0.8s'/> Unit testing: Smallest piece. Individual module or function. Done by developers. <break time='0.5s'/> Integration testing: Modules combined. Testing interfaces between components. Done by developers or QA. <break time='0.5s'/> System testing: Complete system. End-to-end functionality. Done by QA team. <break time='0.5s'/> UAT: User acceptance testing. Business users verify it meets their needs. Done by business. <break time='0.5s'/> Regression testing: Verify changes don't break existing functionality. Re-run previous tests. <break time='0.8s'/> Specialized testing types: <break time='0.5s'/> Performance testing: Does it handle the load? Response times under stress. <break time='0.5s'/> Security testing: Can it be compromised? Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning. <break time='0.5s'/> Alpha testing: Internal testing before external. <break time='0.5s'/> Beta testing: External testing before general release. <break time='0.8s'/> Key pattern: Testing progresses from small to large, from developers to users. Unit, integration, system, UAT. <break time='0.5s'/> Exam application: If the question asks what type of testing the business performs, it's UAT. If the question asks what testing verifies interfaces, it's integration. If the question asks what testing catches defects introduced by changes, it's regression.
