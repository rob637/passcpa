Welcome to Pass CISA <break time='0.5s' /> This video covers Cloud Computing Audit Considerations <break time='0.3s' /> essential knowledge as organizations increasingly move to the cloud.

<break time='1.0s' />

Cloud computing shifts IT resources to third-party providers <break time='0.3s' /> This changes the risk landscape and requires new audit approaches. Auditors must understand shared responsibility models and cloud-specific risks.

<break time='1.0s' />

The three main service models are <break time='0.3s' /> Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS <break time='0.3s' /> where the provider manages hardware <break time='0.3s' /> Platform as a Service or PaaS <break time='0.3s' /> where the provider also manages operating systems <break time='0.3s' /> And Software as a Service or SaaS <break time='0.3s' /> where the provider manages everything except user data and access.

<break time='0.8s' />

Key cloud audit considerations include <break time='0.3s' /> Data location and sovereignty <break time='0.3s' /> where is data stored and what laws apply <break time='0.3s' /> Vendor lock-in risk <break time='0.3s' /> can you move to another provider <break time='0.3s' /> Shared infrastructure <break time='0.3s' /> is there adequate isolation between tenants <break time='0.3s' /> And right to audit <break time='0.3s' /> can you or a third party examine provider controls.

<break time='1.0s' />

SOC reports are critical for cloud assurance <break time='0.3s' /> SOC 2 Type 2 reports provide independent verification of provider controls. Review these reports for the services you use <break time='0.3s' /> checking coverage period <break time='0.3s' /> scope <break time='0.3s' /> and any exceptions noted.

<break time='0.8s' />

Remember <break time='0.3s' /> outsourcing to the cloud doesn't outsource accountability. The organization remains responsible for data protection and regulatory compliance.

<break time='0.8s' />

That's cloud computing audit <break time='0.3s' /> service models <break time='0.3s' /> shared responsibility <break time='0.3s' /> and third-party assurance. Good luck on exam day!
