CISA-D1-OV-01,Domain 1 Overview: The IS Audit Process,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,15,overview,"Welcome to Domain 1 of the CISA exam. I'm Marcus, and I've been conducting IS audits for over fifteen years. <break time='0.8s'/> This domain carries twenty-one percent of your exam score. That's roughly thirty-two questions. And here's what makes it special: <break time='0.5s'/> while the other domains test what you know about IT, this domain tests whether you know how to audit. <break time='1s'/> Think of Domain 1 as your auditor's toolkit. We'll cover the entire audit lifecycle, from that first planning meeting all the way through the final report. <break time='0.5s'/> You'll learn why we use risk-based auditing, how to gather evidence that actually holds up, and when to use statistical sampling versus judgmental sampling. <break time='0.8s'/> Here's a mental map for you. Domain 1 breaks into three big chunks. First: Planning. This is where you scope the audit, assess risks, and figure out what you're actually going to test. Second: Execution. This is fieldwork. You're gathering evidence, testing controls, documenting everything. Third: Reporting. You communicate findings, get management responses, and track remediation. <break time='1s'/> Now, why does ISACA weight this at twenty-one percent? Because you can memorize every IT control in existence, but if you don't know how to properly plan an audit, gather sufficient evidence, and communicate findings professionally, you're not ready to be a CISA. <break time='0.8s'/> The exam will test your judgment. They'll give you scenarios where you need to decide: What's the next step? What evidence is most reliable? When do you escalate? <break time='0.5s'/> As you work through the lessons and practice questions in this domain, keep asking yourself: What would a competent IS auditor do in this situation? <break time='0.8s'/> Let's build your audit foundation. See you in the next video where we'll break down the complete IS audit lifecycle."
CISA-D1-MA-01,Domain 1 Memory Aids,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,5,memory_aid,"Let's lock in the key terms from Domain 1 with some memory tricks that will stick. <break time='0.5s'/> First up: the types of audit evidence. Remember: PAID. P for Physical observation. A for Analytical procedures. I for Inquiries and interviews. D for Documentation review. When the exam asks about evidence, think: have I been PAID? <break time='0.8s'/> Next: sampling. There are two types, and they rhyme. Statistical is mathematical. Judgmental is judgmental. Statistical sampling lets you project results to the whole population with measurable confidence. Judgmental relies on your professional expertise. Neither is wrong; they serve different purposes. <break time='0.8s'/> For audit risk, remember this formula: Audit Risk equals Inherent Risk times Control Risk times Detection Risk. The shortcut? A equals I times C times D. Or just remember: I Can Detect. Inherent, Control, Detection. <break time='0.5s'/> Finally, control testing. Compliance testing asks: Is the control being followed? Substantive testing asks: Are the numbers accurate? Think: Compliance is about Conformance. Substantive is about Substance, the actual data. <break time='0.8s'/> Quick review. PAID for evidence types. Statistical is mathematical. I Can Detect for audit risk. Compliance equals conformance, substantive equals substance. <break time='0.5s'/> These will come back to you when you need them most."
CISA-D1-CO-01,The IS Audit Lifecycle,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,12,concept,"Every IS audit follows the same fundamental lifecycle. Master this, and you'll have a framework for answering any audit procedural question on the exam. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase one: Audit Planning. This is where most audits succeed or fail. You start by understanding the audit subject. What system? What process? What's the scope? Then you conduct a preliminary risk assessment. Where are the high-risk areas that deserve more testing? You develop your audit program, which is your detailed roadmap of what you'll test and how. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's an exam trap: the audit program should be flexible, not rigid. Conditions change during fieldwork. A good auditor adapts. <break time='1s'/> Phase two: Fieldwork and Evidence Gathering. Now you're in the field, executing your audit program. You're interviewing personnel, observing processes, reviewing documentation, and running technical tests. Everything gets documented in your workpapers. <break time='0.5s'/> Key point for the exam: documentation must be sufficient for another qualified auditor to understand what you did and why. If it's not in the workpapers, it didn't happen. <break time='1s'/> Phase three: Analysis and Evaluation. You've gathered your evidence. Now you evaluate what it means. Are controls designed properly? Are they operating effectively? Where are the gaps? This is where you identify findings and assess their significance. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase four: Reporting. You document your findings, conclusions, and recommendations. Before the final report, you hold an exit conference with management. This is critical: it's where management can correct factual errors and provide responses to findings. No surprises in the final report. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase five: Follow-Up. The audit isn't truly complete until you verify that management has addressed the findings. This might be a separate follow-up audit or part of the next regular audit cycle. <break time='0.5s'/> On the exam, remember: auditors provide assurance and make recommendations. We don't implement controls ourselves. That would compromise our independence."
CISA-D1-CO-02,Risk-Based Auditing,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,10,concept,"Why do we use risk-based auditing? Because we can't audit everything. Resources are finite. Time is limited. So we focus our effort where it matters most. <break time='0.8s'/> Risk-based auditing means we direct our work toward the areas with the highest risk of material misstatement, fraud, or control failure. The higher the risk, the more testing we do. <break time='0.5s'/> Let me break down how this works in practice. <break time='1s'/> Step one: Identify the audit universe. What systems, processes, and controls could we audit? This is your full inventory. <break time='0.8s'/> Step two: Assess risk for each item. We look at inherent risk, which is the risk that exists before any controls. And we look at control risk, which is the risk that controls won't prevent or detect problems. We might also consider business impact. If this system fails, what's the damage? <break time='0.8s'/> Step three: Prioritize. High risk areas get more audit attention. Low risk areas get less, or maybe just a basic review. This becomes your audit plan. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's a common exam scenario: You have limited time and need to decide where to focus. The answer is almost always: focus on high-risk areas first. An item that's high impact and has weak controls should be at the top of your list. <break time='1s'/> Now, here's a nuance the exam tests. Risk assessment is not a one-time event. You should reassess risk continuously during the audit. If you discover something unexpected during fieldwork, you adjust your approach. <break time='0.8s'/> One more concept: audit risk. This is the risk that you, the auditor, will issue an incorrect opinion. You might say controls are effective when they're not. Audit risk has three components. Inherent risk and control risk are outside your control. But detection risk is within your control. You reduce detection risk by doing more testing, using better procedures, and applying professional skepticism. <break time='0.5s'/> The formula is: Audit Risk equals Inherent Risk times Control Risk times Detection Risk. Remember: I Can Detect."
CISA-D2-OV-01,Domain 2 Overview: IT Governance,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,15,overview,"Welcome to Domain 2: Governance and Management of IT. I'm Sarah, and I specialize in IT governance frameworks. <break time='0.8s'/> This domain represents seventeen percent of your exam, roughly twenty-five questions. And let me tell you, this is where many candidates struggle. Not because the concepts are hard, but because they blur together. Governance, management, COBIT, ITIL, ISO. It can feel like alphabet soup. <break time='0.5s'/> Let's bring clarity. <break time='1s'/> The central question of Domain 2 is this: Is IT being directed, controlled, and measured in a way that supports the organization's objectives? <break time='0.8s'/> Here's the map. Domain 2 covers four major areas. <break time='0.5s'/> First: IT Governance versus IT Management. These are not the same thing. Governance is about direction and oversight. It's what the board and executives do. Management is about execution. It's what IT leadership does day to day. The exam loves this distinction. <break time='0.8s'/> Second: Frameworks. COBIT for governance, ITIL for service management, ISO 27001 for security, COSO for enterprise risk. You don't need to memorize every detail, but you need to know what each framework does and when to use it. <break time='0.8s'/> Third: Strategy and Planning. How does IT strategy align with business strategy? What's the IT strategic plan? What about the portfolio of IT investments? <break time='0.8s'/> Fourth: Risk and Resource Management. How does the organization identify, assess, and respond to IT risks? How does it manage IT resources: people, money, vendors? <break time='1s'/> Here's why this domain matters for auditors. When you audit any IT area, you're ultimately asking whether governance and management provided appropriate direction and oversight. Weak governance is the root cause of many IT failures. <break time='0.5s'/> As we go through this domain, pay attention to roles and responsibilities. Who owns what? The board provides oversight. Management provides direction. IT implements. When these boundaries blur, problems occur. <break time='0.8s'/> Let's dig into the frameworks and build your governance foundation."
CISA-D2-MA-01,COBIT vs ITIL vs ISO Visual Guide,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,5,memory_aid,"Three frameworks, three different purposes. Let's sort them out so you never confuse them again. <break time='0.8s'/> COBIT. Think: Control Objectives. COBIT is about IT governance and management. It helps organizations ensure that IT delivers value and manages risk. When the exam asks about aligning IT with business goals, or about governance frameworks, COBIT is usually the answer. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: COBIT has Objectives. Big picture governance. <break time='1s'/> ITIL. Think: IT Service Management. ITIL is about delivering IT services efficiently. Incident management, problem management, change management, service desk. When the exam asks about IT operations and service delivery, ITIL is usually the answer. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: ITIL serves IT. Service management. <break time='1s'/> ISO 27001 and 27002. Think: Information Security. ISO 27001 is the standard for information security management systems. 27002 provides the security controls. When the exam asks about security governance or security standards, ISO 27000 series is usually the answer. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: ISO secures Info. Security standards. <break time='0.8s'/> Quick summary to lock it in. COBIT governs. ITIL serves. ISO secures. <break time='0.5s'/> One more tip: these frameworks aren't competitors. Organizations often use all three together. COBIT for governance, ITIL for operations, ISO for security. They're complementary layers."
CISA-D2-FW-01,COBIT Framework Deep Dive,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,15,framework,"COBIT is the most frequently tested framework on the CISA exam. Let's make sure you understand it inside and out. <break time='0.8s'/> COBIT stands for Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology. It was created by ISACA, the same organization that certifies CISAs. It provides a comprehensive framework for IT governance and management. <break time='0.5s'/> The current version is COBIT 2019, though the exam tests concepts rather than version-specific details. <break time='1s'/> Let's start with the core components. <break time='0.8s'/> First: Governance Objectives. COBIT identifies five governance objectives: Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor, often called EDM. Governance ensures that stakeholder needs are evaluated, direction is set, and performance is monitored. <break time='0.5s'/> Second: Management Objectives. COBIT groups management into four domains. APO means Align, Plan, and Organize. This includes strategy, enterprise architecture, and portfolio management. BAI means Build, Acquire, and Implement. This covers programs, projects, and change management. DSS means Deliver, Service, and Support. This is operations and service delivery. MEA means Monitor, Evaluate, and Assess. This is performance monitoring and compliance. <break time='0.8s'/> Memory trick for the domains: APO BAI DSS MEA. Or think: A People Business Does Some Special Meaningful Effort Always. <break time='1s'/> Now, how do you audit using COBIT? You assess whether the organization has defined processes, whether those processes are being followed, and whether they're achieving the intended outcomes. COBIT provides maturity models to help you rate process capability from incomplete to optimized. <break time='0.8s'/> Common exam scenarios: The question describes an IT problem. Your job is to identify which COBIT domain or process is most relevant. Strategy problem? APO. Implementation problem? BAI. Operations problem? DSS. Monitoring problem? MEA. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's an auditor's perspective: COBIT gives you a common language to discuss IT governance with management. Instead of saying 'your change process is broken,' you can reference COBIT BAI06 and point to specific control objectives that aren't being met. <break time='0.8s'/> Remember: COBIT is about governance. It helps you answer the question: Is IT being directed and controlled properly?"
CISA-D2-CP-01,IT Governance vs IT Management,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,8,comparison,"This is one of the most tested distinctions on the CISA exam. IT Governance versus IT Management. Let's make sure you never confuse them. <break time='1s'/> IT Governance asks: Are we doing the right things? IT Management asks: Are we doing things right? <break time='0.8s'/> Governance is about direction, oversight, and accountability. It's performed by the board of directors and executive management. They set strategic direction. They approve major investments. They ensure IT supports business objectives. <break time='0.5s'/> Management is about execution, implementation, and day-to-day operations. It's performed by IT leadership: the CIO, IT directors, managers. They implement the strategy. They run the operations. They deliver services. <break time='1s'/> Here's a simple test. If someone is setting policy, that's governance. If someone is implementing policy, that's management. If someone is providing oversight, that's governance. If someone is doing the work, that's management. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam trap: The question might describe a scenario and ask who is responsible. If it's about oversight, approval, or strategic direction, the answer involves the board or senior executives, meaning governance. If it's about implementation, operations, or technical decisions, the answer involves IT management. <break time='0.5s'/> Another trap: sometimes candidates think governance only applies to large enterprises. Wrong. Every organization, regardless of size, needs governance. The formality might differ, but the function is essential. <break time='1s'/> One more key point: Governance and management are not separate silos. They interact continuously. The board provides direction, management reports on performance, the board evaluates results and adjusts direction. It's a cycle. <break time='0.5s'/> Lock this in: Governance equals direction and oversight. Management equals execution and operations. Board governs. CIO manages."
CISA-D3-OV-01,Domain 3 Overview: Building Systems,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,12,overview,"Welcome to Domain 3: Information Systems Acquisition, Development, and Implementation. <break time='0.5s'/> At twelve percent, this is the smallest domain on the exam. But don't underestimate it. The questions here can be tricky because they test whether you understand the full system development lifecycle. <break time='1s'/> The core question of Domain 3 is this: When an organization builds or buys a system, are appropriate controls in place throughout the process? <break time='0.8s'/> Let me walk you through the territory. <break time='0.5s'/> First: The System Development Life Cycle, or SDLC. This is the backbone of Domain 3. You need to know the phases: feasibility study, requirements definition, design, development, testing, implementation, and post-implementation review. Each phase has specific control objectives. <break time='0.8s'/> Second: Methodologies. Waterfall versus Agile. Traditional versus iterative. The exam will test whether you know the differences and when each approach is appropriate. More importantly, you need to know how audit procedures differ based on the methodology used. <break time='0.8s'/> Third: Testing. Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing, regression testing. What's the purpose of each? What order do they occur? Who's responsible? <break time='0.8s'/> Fourth: Change Management. Once a system is in production, how do changes get approved, tested, and implemented? This is a critical control area because unauthorized changes can introduce vulnerabilities or instability. <break time='0.5s'/> Fifth: Data Migration. When moving from an old system to a new system, how do you ensure data integrity? This is often overlooked but heavily tested. <break time='1s'/> From an auditor's perspective, we're looking for segregation of duties throughout the lifecycle. Developers shouldn't have access to production. Users should be involved in testing and approval. Changes should be authorized, tested, and documented. <break time='0.5s'/> The exam loves scenarios where something goes wrong during implementation. Your job is to identify what control was missing or bypassed. <break time='0.8s'/> Let's build your SDLC knowledge."
CISA-D3-MA-01,SDLC Phases Visual Map,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,5,memory_aid,"The System Development Life Cycle has seven phases. Let's create a visual map you can recall during the exam. <break time='0.8s'/> Think of it as building a house. <break time='0.5s'/> Phase one: Feasibility Study. Can we build this? Should we? This is where you assess technical feasibility, economic viability, and operational practicality. You're answering: Does this project make sense? <break time='0.8s'/> Phase two: Requirements Definition. What exactly are we building? You gather detailed requirements from stakeholders. Functional requirements say what the system must do. Non-functional requirements cover performance, security, and usability. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase three: Design. How will we build it? This includes architecture, database design, interface design, and security design. You're creating the blueprints. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase four: Development. Building time. Programmers write code. Configurations are set. The system takes shape. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase five: Testing. Does it work? Unit testing checks individual components. Integration testing checks how components work together. System testing checks the whole thing. UAT, or user acceptance testing, confirms it meets user needs. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase six: Implementation. Go live. The system moves to production. Users are trained. Data is migrated. <break time='0.8s'/> Phase seven: Post-Implementation Review. Did we succeed? You evaluate whether the project met its objectives and capture lessons learned. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: Think FRDDITD. Feasibility, Requirements, Design, Development, Implementation, Testing, Documentation. Or use a phrase: Friendly Rabbits Don't Destroy Tall Indoor Plants. <break time='0.5s'/> Wait, I mixed up the order. Testing comes before Implementation. Let's use: FRDDT-IP. Feasibility, Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Implementation, Post-review. <break time='0.5s'/> Better phrase: Friendly Rabbits Design Dope Technology, Implement Perfectly."
CISA-D4-OV-01,Domain 4 Overview: Keeping IT Running,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,15,overview,"Welcome to Domain 4: Information Systems Operations and Business Resilience. I'm David, and I've spent my career keeping critical systems running. <break time='0.8s'/> This is the second largest domain at twenty-three percent. That's roughly thirty-four questions. And here's what makes it special: this is where theory meets the real world. <break time='1s'/> The core question of Domain 4: Can the organization keep its systems running and recover if something goes wrong? <break time='0.8s'/> Let me map out the territory. Domain 4 breaks into two major areas. <break time='0.5s'/> First: IT Operations. This is the day-to-day running of technology. We're talking data center management, batch processing, job scheduling, helpdesk, incident management, problem management. All the things that keep the lights on. <break time='0.8s'/> Second: Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. What happens when things go wrong? How do you maintain critical business functions during a disruption? How do you recover systems after a disaster? This includes business impact analysis, recovery strategies, backup and restore, and testing. <break time='1s'/> The exam tests both your knowledge and your judgment. They'll give you scenarios: A server fails. A data center floods. Ransomware encrypts your files. You need to know the correct procedures and priorities. <break time='0.5s'/> Key concepts you'll see repeatedly: RTO, Recovery Time Objective. How quickly must we recover? RPO, Recovery Point Objective. How much data loss is acceptable? MTD, Maximum Tolerable Downtime. How long can the business survive without this system? <break time='0.8s'/> For operations, you'll need to understand incident versus problem management. An incident is an unplanned interruption. A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. We restore service for incidents. We find root causes for problems. <break time='0.8s'/> From an auditor's perspective, we're looking for two things. One: appropriate controls over daily operations. Two: tested, realistic recovery plans that match business requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> I'll help you understand both. Let's dive in."
CISA-D4-MA-01,BCP and DRP Recovery Metrics,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,5,memory_aid,"Three metrics you absolutely must know for the exam: RTO, RPO, and MTD. Let's lock them in. <break time='0.8s'/> RPO: Recovery Point Objective. Ask yourself: How much data can I lose? RPO measures backward in time. If your RPO is four hours, you need backups at least every four hours. Losing more than four hours of data would be unacceptable. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: RPO looks backward. P for Past. Point in the past we can recover to. <break time='1s'/> RTO: Recovery Time Objective. Ask yourself: How fast must I recover? RTO measures forward from the disaster. If your RTO is four hours, you must have systems running again within four hours of the disruption. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: RTO looks forward. T for Time to recover. <break time='1s'/> MTD: Maximum Tolerable Downtime. Ask yourself: How long can the business survive? MTD is the absolute limit. Beyond MTD, the organization faces catastrophic consequences, potentially going out of business. <break time='0.5s'/> MTD should always be greater than RTO. If your MTD is eight hours, your RTO better be less than that. <break time='0.8s'/> Here's how they relate. RPO determines your backup strategy. RTO determines your recovery strategy. MTD determines your business continuity requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> Quick visual: Disaster strikes at time zero. RPO looks back, asking how much data we lost. RTO looks forward, asking how long until we're running. MTD is the absolute deadline. <break time='0.5s'/> One more phrase to remember: Point in the Past, Time to recover, Maximum Tolerable. RPO, RTO, MTD."
CISA-D4-CP-01,BCP vs DRP,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,10,comparison,"Business Continuity Planning versus Disaster Recovery Planning. The exam expects you to know the difference. <break time='1s'/> Let's start with definitions. <break time='0.8s'/> Business Continuity Planning, BCP, focuses on keeping critical business functions operating during and after a disruption. It's business-focused. It's proactive. It asks: How do we keep serving customers even when something goes wrong? <break time='0.8s'/> Disaster Recovery Planning, DRP, focuses on restoring IT systems and data after a disruption. It's technology-focused. It's reactive. It asks: How do we get our systems back up after they go down? <break time='1s'/> Think of it this way: BCP keeps the business running. DRP brings IT back. <break time='0.5s'/> Here's a scenario to make it concrete. A fire destroys your main office. <break time='0.5s'/> BCP determines: Where do employees work? How do we answer customer calls? How do we process orders? It might involve alternate work locations, cross-trained staff, and manual workarounds. <break time='0.5s'/> DRP determines: How do we restore email? How do we recover the database? How do we reconnect to the network? It involves backup restoration, alternate data centers, and system failover. <break time='1s'/> Key exam point: BCP is broader. DRP is a subset of BCP. You need both, but business continuity is the bigger picture. <break time='0.8s'/> Another distinction: Scope. BCP covers the whole organization, including people, processes, facilities, and technology. DRP primarily covers technology and data. <break time='0.8s'/> Who's responsible? BCP is owned by business leadership, often through a steering committee. DRP is owned by IT, typically the CIO or IT director. But both require executive sponsorship. <break time='0.5s'/> One more exam trap: They might describe a plan and ask you to identify it. If it's about maintaining business operations, it's BCP. If it's specifically about restoring IT infrastructure, it's DRP."
CISA-D4-CO-01,RTO RPO MTD Explained,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,10,concept,"Let's go deep on recovery objectives because the exam will test your ability to apply these concepts. <break time='0.8s'/> Recovery Point Objective: How much data loss is acceptable. <break time='0.5s'/> This drives your backup strategy. If your RPO is zero, you need real-time replication. No data loss is acceptable. This is expensive but required for some systems. If your RPO is twenty-four hours, daily backups are sufficient. You can afford to lose up to a day of work. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam application: A question describes a system with hourly backups. A failure occurs at three PM, and the last backup was at one PM. What's the data loss? Two hours. Is this acceptable? Only if the RPO is two hours or greater. <break time='1s'/> Recovery Time Objective: How quickly must systems be operational. <break time='0.5s'/> This drives your recovery strategy. If your RTO is near zero, you need hot standby systems ready to take over immediately. Expensive, but necessary for critical systems. If your RTO is seventy-two hours, you have time to restore from backups and potentially use a cold site. Less expensive, appropriate for non-critical systems. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam application: A question asks about choosing between recovery sites. Hot sites have fastest RTO, highest cost. Cold sites have slowest RTO, lowest cost. Match the site type to the business requirements. <break time='1s'/> Maximum Tolerable Downtime: The survival threshold. <break time='0.5s'/> MTD is determined through Business Impact Analysis. It answers: At what point does this outage threaten the organization's survival? MTD is always defined by business leadership, not IT. <break time='0.8s'/> Here's the critical relationship: RTO must be less than MTD. If MTD is seventy-two hours and your RTO is ninety-six hours, you have a gap. You'll recover, but it might be too late. <break time='0.5s'/> One more nuance: Different systems have different objectives. Your customer-facing website might have an RTO of one hour. Your HR system might have an RTO of seventy-two hours. You tier your systems based on criticality and allocate recovery resources accordingly."
CISA-D5-OV-01,Domain 5 Overview: Protecting Information Assets,Natalie_Expressive_public,en-US-AriaNeural,15,overview,"Welcome to Domain 5: Protection of Information Assets. I'm Nicole, and security is my specialty. <break time='0.8s'/> This is the big one. At twenty-seven percent, Domain 5 is the largest on the exam. That's roughly forty questions. If you want to pass the CISA, you need to own this domain. <break time='1s'/> The fundamental question here is simple but profound: Is the organization adequately protecting its information and information systems from threats? <break time='0.8s'/> Let me give you the layout. Domain 5 covers six major areas. <break time='0.5s'/> First: Information Security Governance and Management. How does the organization define, implement, and maintain security? What policies exist? Who's accountable? <break time='0.8s'/> Second: Access Controls. This is huge on the exam. Who can access what? How is identity verified? How are permissions assigned and managed? <break time='0.8s'/> Third: Network Security. Firewalls, intrusion detection, network segmentation, VPNs, wireless security. How does the organization protect its network perimeter and internal communications? <break time='0.8s'/> Fourth: Cryptography. Encryption, hashing, digital signatures, PKI. You need to understand how cryptography protects data and enables authentication. <break time='0.8s'/> Fifth: Security Operations. Vulnerability management, security monitoring, incident response. How does the organization detect and respond to threats? <break time='0.8s'/> Sixth: Physical and Environmental Security. Not everything is cyber. Facilities, data centers, equipment protection, and environmental controls are all in scope. <break time='1s'/> The exam will test your understanding of control types: preventive, detective, corrective, deterrent, compensating. Know what each type does and recognize them in scenarios. <break time='0.8s'/> From an IS auditor's perspective, we're assessing whether security controls are properly designed, appropriately implemented, and effectively operating. We look at policies, we test technical controls, we evaluate security awareness, and we review incident handling. <break time='0.5s'/> This domain is comprehensive, but I'll make sure you're ready. Let's secure that passing score."
CISA-D5-MA-01,Control Types Visual Matrix,Natalie_Expressive_public,en-US-AriaNeural,5,memory_aid,"Control types is one of the most frequently tested topics in Domain 5. Let's create a mental matrix you can recall instantly. <break time='0.8s'/> There are three primary control types based on timing. Preventive controls stop bad things before they happen. Detective controls identify bad things while or after they happen. Corrective controls fix things after something goes wrong. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory phrase: PDC. Prevent, Detect, Correct. Or: Please Don't Crash. <break time='1s'/> Now let's populate each category with examples. <break time='0.5s'/> Preventive: Access controls that block unauthorized users. Encryption that keeps data unreadable. Segregation of duties that prevents fraud. Training that stops user errors. Think: anything that blocks or stops. <break time='0.8s'/> Detective: Audit logs that record activity. Intrusion detection systems that alert on attacks. Reconciliations that identify discrepancies. Reviews that catch errors. Think: anything that watches or alerts. <break time='0.8s'/> Corrective: Backups that restore lost data. Disaster recovery that brings systems back. Incident response that contains breaches. Patches that fix vulnerabilities. Think: anything that fixes or restores. <break time='1s'/> Two more control types to know. Deterrent controls discourage bad behavior. Security cameras and warning signs are examples. They don't directly prevent or detect, but they reduce likelihood. <break time='0.5s'/> Compensating controls provide alternative protection when primary controls can't be implemented. If you can't segregate duties because your team is too small, a compensating control might be management review of all transactions. <break time='0.8s'/> Lock it in: PDC plus deterrent and compensating. Prevent, Detect, Correct, Discourage, Compensate."
CISA-D5-MA-02,Cryptography Quick Reference,Natalie_Expressive_public,en-US-AriaNeural,5,memory_aid,"Cryptography can feel overwhelming, but you only need to know a handful of concepts for the exam. Let's simplify. <break time='0.8s'/> Two types of encryption: symmetric and asymmetric. <break time='0.5s'/> Symmetric uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt. Think: Same key, Symmetric starts with S, Same starts with S. Fast, efficient, but you have the key distribution problem. How do you securely share the key? <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: AES, DES, 3DES. <break time='1s'/> Asymmetric uses two different keys: a public key and a private key. What one encrypts, only the other can decrypt. Solves the key distribution problem because you can share the public key freely. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: RSA, ECC. <break time='0.8s'/> When do you use each? Symmetric for encrypting large amounts of data because it's fast. Asymmetric for key exchange and digital signatures because it solves the trust problem. Many systems use both: asymmetric to exchange a symmetric key, then symmetric for the actual data. <break time='1s'/> Hashing is different from encryption. A hash is a one-way function. You can hash data but you can't unhash it. Used to verify integrity, not confidentiality. If even one bit changes, the hash changes completely. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: SHA-256, MD5 (though MD5 is deprecated). <break time='1s'/> Digital signatures combine hashing and asymmetric cryptography. You hash the message, then encrypt the hash with your private key. Recipients decrypt with your public key and compare hashes. This proves authenticity and integrity. <break time='0.5s'/> Memory trick: A signature is personal, so you use your private key to create it."
CISA-EX-ES-01,How ISACA Writes Questions,Bryan_FitnessCoach_public,en-US-DavisNeural,12,exam_strategy,"I'm James, and I'm going to share insider knowledge about how ISACA constructs exam questions. Once you see the patterns, these questions become much more manageable. <break time='1s'/> First, understand the question structure. CISA questions are scenario-based multiple choice. You'll get a situation, a specific question, and four choices. Only one answer is the best answer. <break time='0.5s'/> Notice I said best answer, not correct answer. Often, two or three options could work in the real world. Your job is to identify the most appropriate response according to ISACA standards. <break time='1s'/> Let's talk about common question patterns. <break time='0.8s'/> Pattern one: The first step question. The scenario describes a situation and asks: What should the auditor do first? The trap is choosing an action that's valid but not the first step. Usually, the first step involves understanding the situation, assessing risk, or planning before jumping to action. <break time='0.8s'/> Pattern two: The most important question. Several controls or actions are listed. Which is most important? The answer typically relates to the factor with the greatest risk impact or the foundational element that enables everything else. <break time='0.8s'/> Pattern three: The best answer question. All four options seem reasonable. You need to identify the one that most directly addresses the scenario. Eliminate distractors by asking: Does this specifically solve the problem described? <break time='1s'/> How to eliminate wrong answers. <break time='0.5s'/> Look for absolutes. Words like always, never, or must are often traps. Security and audit rarely deal in absolutes. <break time='0.5s'/> Watch for out-of-scope answers. If the question is about audit planning, an answer about audit reporting is probably wrong. <break time='0.5s'/> Beware of technically correct but inappropriate answers. An action might be valid but not appropriate for the specific role or timing described. <break time='1s'/> Final tip: Think like a CISA, not an IT technician. The exam tests whether you think like an auditor. Your job is to assess, evaluate, and provide assurance. You're not the implementer. When in doubt, choose the answer that demonstrates professional skepticism, evidence-based judgment, and appropriate communication."
CISA-EX-ES-02,Common CISA Traps and How to Avoid Them,Bryan_FitnessCoach_public,en-US-DavisNeural,10,exam_strategy,"Let me share the most common traps I've seen candidates fall into and how to avoid them. <break time='1s'/> Trap one: Recommending implementation. <break time='0.5s'/> The question describes a control weakness and asks what the auditor should do. Many candidates choose an answer that says the auditor should implement the missing control. Wrong. Auditors don't implement. We recommend, we report, we advise. But we don't do the remediation ourselves. That would compromise our independence. <break time='0.5s'/> When you see this trap, look for the answer that involves reporting to management or recommending corrective action. <break time='1s'/> Trap two: Scope creep. <break time='0.5s'/> During an audit of System A, you discover problems with System B. The question asks your next step. The trap answer is to immediately investigate System B. The correct approach is to note the finding, complete your current scope, and report the issue for potential future audit coverage. Auditors work within defined scope. <break time='1s'/> Trap three: Bypassing management. <break time='0.5s'/> You discover fraud. The question asks who you should tell. The trap is to choose the external auditors or law enforcement. Generally, you first inform appropriate management and let them decide on escalation, unless management is involved in the fraud. Then you go to the audit committee or board. <break time='1s'/> Trap four: Relying on inadequate evidence. <break time='0.5s'/> You conducted interviews and reviewed documentation. The question asks if you have sufficient evidence. Interview evidence alone is weak because it's based on what people say, not what they do. You need corroborating evidence. If the only evidence is verbal, the answer is usually that more testing is needed. <break time='1s'/> Trap five: Ignoring materiality and risk. <break time='0.5s'/> Not all findings deserve the same attention. A question might present a minor issue and ask your response. The trap is treating everything as critical. Auditors consider materiality and relative risk. A minor control gap in a low-risk area doesn't warrant emergency escalation. <break time='0.5s'/> Remember these traps. They appear repeatedly in different forms."
