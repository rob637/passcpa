CISA-D1-CO-03,Audit Evidence Types and Reliability,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,12,concept,"Not all evidence is created equal. On the CISA exam, you need to know which evidence is most reliable and why. <break time='0.8s'/> Let's establish the hierarchy. <break time='1s'/> Evidence obtained directly by the auditor is more reliable than evidence provided by others. If I personally observe a control being performed, that's stronger than if someone tells me they perform the control. <break time='0.8s'/> Evidence obtained from independent sources outside the organization is more reliable than evidence from within. A bank confirmation of account balances beats an internal spreadsheet. <break time='0.8s'/> Documentary evidence is more reliable than verbal representations. Written policies beat verbal descriptions of how things work. <break time='0.8s'/> Original documents are more reliable than copies. Faxes and photocopies can be altered. <break time='1s'/> Now let's categorize the types. <break time='0.5s'/> Physical observation. You watch someone perform the control. Highly reliable because you see it yourself, but it only proves the control operated at that moment. <break time='0.8s'/> Documentation review. You examine policies, procedures, logs, configurations. Provides evidence of design and historical operation, but documents can be falsified. <break time='0.8s'/> Inquiry and interview. You ask questions and get verbal responses. Useful for understanding processes but weakest standing alone because people might not tell the truth or might not know the truth. <break time='0.8s'/> Re-performance. You perform the control yourself to verify it works. Very strong because you're testing directly, but time-consuming. <break time='0.8s'/> Analytical procedures. You examine patterns and relationships in data. Useful for detecting anomalies, but requires corroboration. <break time='1s'/> Exam tip: If a question asks whether you have sufficient evidence and the only evidence is interview responses, the answer is usually no. You need corroborating evidence from other sources."
CISA-D1-CO-04,Sampling Techniques for IS Auditors,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,10,concept,"When you can't test everything, you sample. But how you sample matters enormously for the validity of your conclusions. <break time='1s'/> Two fundamental approaches: statistical and non-statistical, also called judgmental. <break time='0.8s'/> Statistical sampling uses mathematical principles. You select samples randomly, and the math lets you project results to the entire population with measurable confidence. You can make statements like: We are ninety-five percent confident the error rate is below two percent. <break time='0.5s'/> Non-statistical sampling relies on auditor judgment. You choose items based on experience, risk factors, or specific criteria. It's valid when done properly, but you cannot mathematically project results to the population. <break time='1s'/> When do you use each? <break time='0.5s'/> Use statistical sampling when you need to quantify risk, when the population is large and homogeneous, and when you need defensible, objective results. <break time='0.5s'/> Use judgmental sampling when you're targeting high-risk items specifically, when the population is small, or when statistical sampling isn't practical. <break time='1s'/> Key statistical concepts for the exam. <break time='0.5s'/> Confidence level: How certain are you in your results? Common levels are ninety and ninety-five percent. Higher confidence requires larger samples. <break time='0.5s'/> Tolerable error rate: The maximum error you're willing to accept. Lower tolerance requires larger samples. <break time='0.5s'/> Expected error rate: What you think you'll find based on prior audits. Higher expected error requires larger samples. <break time='0.8s'/> Sample size relationship: Larger populations need larger samples, but the relationship isn't linear. Sampling two hundred from a population of ten thousand gives almost as much confidence as sampling from one million."
CISA-D1-CP-01,Compliance Testing vs Substantive Testing,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,8,comparison,"Two types of testing, two different purposes. Let's make sure you never confuse them. <break time='1s'/> Compliance testing, also called tests of controls, asks: Is the control being followed? <break time='0.5s'/> You're testing adherence to policies and procedures. Does management approve high-value transactions as required? Are backups performed according to schedule? Is access review conducted quarterly as policy states? <break time='0.8s'/> You're not testing whether the underlying data is correct. You're testing whether the control operates as designed. <break time='1s'/> Substantive testing asks: Is the data accurate and complete? <break time='0.5s'/> You're testing the information itself. Does the inventory count match the records? Are the account balances correct? Can all transactions be traced to supporting documentation? <break time='0.8s'/> You're not testing whether someone followed a procedure. You're testing whether the result is right. <break time='1s'/> Here's how they work together. <break time='0.5s'/> If compliance testing shows controls are operating effectively, you can reduce the extent of your substantive testing. You have assurance that the controls are catching errors. <break time='0.5s'/> If compliance testing shows controls are weak or not followed, you need more substantive testing. You can't rely on the controls, so you must test the data directly. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam trap: A question might describe a data accuracy issue and ask which type of testing applies. Data accuracy equals substantive. A question about whether someone follows procedures equals compliance. <break time='0.5s'/> Remember: Compliance checks Conformance to controls. Substantive checks the Substance of the data."
CISA-D1-SC-01,Scenario: Your First IS Audit Assignment,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,15,scenario,"You walk into the office Monday morning, and your manager hands you an assignment. You're going to lead the IS audit of the company's new customer relationship management system. It went live three months ago. <break time='0.5s'/> Let's walk through this together. <break time='1s'/> First question you should ask: What's the scope? <break time='0.5s'/> Your manager clarifies: Focus on access controls and data integrity. The system handles sensitive customer information, so the board wants assurance that only authorized personnel can access it and that the data is reliable. <break time='0.8s'/> Now you start planning. What do you do first? <break time='0.5s'/> You request documentation: the system security plan, access control matrix, user provisioning procedures, data validation rules, and any previous audit reports or risk assessments. You also schedule preliminary meetings with the system owner and IT security team. <break time='1s'/> During planning, you assess risk. <break time='0.5s'/> Three months is new. The implementation team might still be tweaking things. That's higher inherent risk. You note that you'll want to verify change controls are in place. <break time='0.5s'/> It's customer data. High sensitivity means high impact if compromised. You'll do more testing in access controls than you might for an internal administrative system. <break time='1s'/> You develop your audit program. For access controls, you'll review the access matrix, test a sample of user accounts against their job functions, verify that terminated employees have been removed, and check administrative account usage. <break time='0.5s'/> For data integrity, you'll review input validation controls, trace a sample of records from source documents to the database, and check for duplicate or orphan records. <break time='1s'/> Now you execute. You conduct interviews, review documentation, and perform testing. You find three issues: five terminated employees still have active accounts, administrative password changes haven't been enforced, and there's no audit log review process. <break time='0.5s'/> What do you do? <break time='0.5s'/> You document your findings with evidence. You assess severity. The terminated employee accounts are high risk. You draft findings and schedule an exit conference. <break time='0.8s'/> At the exit conference, management acknowledges the issues and commits to remediation. You issue your report with findings, recommendations, and management's response. <break time='0.5s'/> Three months later, you'll follow up to verify the issues were addressed. <break time='0.5s'/> That's the audit lifecycle in action."
CISA-D2-FW-02,ITIL for IS Auditors,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,12,framework,"ITIL isn't a governance framework like COBIT. It's a service management framework. And as an IS auditor, you need to understand what it does and when to reference it. <break time='1s'/> ITIL stands for Information Technology Infrastructure Library. It's a set of best practices for IT service management, or ITSM. The focus is on delivering value through services. <break time='0.8s'/> The current version is ITIL 4, which emphasizes the service value system. But for the exam, you need concepts more than version specifics. <break time='1s'/> The core idea: IT exists to provide services to the business. ITIL defines how to design, deliver, and improve those services efficiently and effectively. <break time='0.8s'/> Key ITIL processes you should know. <break time='1s'/> Incident Management: Restoring normal service as quickly as possible when something breaks. An incident is an unplanned interruption. The goal is to minimize business impact. <break time='0.8s'/> Problem Management: Finding the root cause of incidents and preventing recurrence. A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. While incident management is reactive, problem management is proactive. <break time='0.8s'/> Change Management: Controlling changes to the IT environment. All changes should be assessed for risk, approved, tested, and documented. This prevents unauthorized or poorly planned changes from causing incidents. <break time='0.8s'/> Service Desk: The single point of contact between IT and users. Users report issues here, and the service desk manages communication and ticket routing. <break time='1s'/> As an auditor, you evaluate whether these processes exist, whether they're followed, and whether they're effective. <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: Changes made without proper approval. Incidents not properly tracked or escalated. Root cause analysis not performed after major incidents. No service level agreements or SLAs not monitored. <break time='0.5s'/> Remember: COBIT asks if IT is doing the right things. ITIL helps IT do things right."
CISA-D2-FW-03,ISO 27001 and 27002 for Auditors,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,12,framework,"ISO 27001 and 27002 are the international standards for information security management. They're frequently referenced on the CISA exam, so let's clarify what each one does. <break time='1s'/> ISO 27001 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving an Information Security Management System, or ISMS. It's certifiable, meaning organizations can be audited and certified as compliant. <break time='0.5s'/> The core concept is the ISMS framework: Plan, Do, Check, Act. You establish security objectives, implement controls, monitor effectiveness, and continuously improve. <break time='1s'/> ISO 27002 provides detailed guidance on security controls. Think of it as the implementation guide. It describes control objectives and controls across domains like access control, cryptography, physical security, and incident management. <break time='0.5s'/> The relationship: 27001 says what you must do. 27002 says how to do it. <break time='1s'/> Key components of ISO 27001 for the exam. <break time='0.8s'/> Risk assessment: You must identify information assets, assess threats and vulnerabilities, and determine risk levels. <break time='0.8s'/> Statement of Applicability: A documented list of controls selected from the standard and justification for inclusions and exclusions. <break time='0.8s'/> Internal audits: The standard requires regular internal audits of the ISMS. <break time='0.8s'/> Management review: Top management must review the ISMS periodically to ensure its continuing suitability and effectiveness. <break time='1s'/> As an IS auditor, if the organization claims ISO 27001 certification, you can request evidence of that certification and use the standard as a benchmark. If they're not certified but reference the standard, you verify their actual practices against their claims. <break time='0.5s'/> Exam application: If a question mentions security standards or information security management systems, ISO 27000 series is usually the relevant reference."
CISA-D2-FW-04,Risk Management Frameworks ERM and COSO,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,12,framework,"Risk management is foundational to everything we audit. Let's understand the major frameworks, with particular focus on COSO, which frequently appears on the CISA exam. <break time='1s'/> COSO stands for Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. They published two major frameworks: the Internal Control Framework and the Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, Framework. <break time='0.8s'/> The COSO Internal Control Framework defines internal control as having five components. <break time='0.5s'/> Control Environment: The tone at the top, ethics, and organizational culture that influence control consciousness. <break time='0.5s'/> Risk Assessment: Identifying and analyzing risks that could prevent achieving objectives. <break time='0.5s'/> Control Activities: The policies and procedures that ensure management directives are carried out. <break time='0.5s'/> Information and Communication: Capturing and exchanging information needed to conduct, manage, and control operations. <break time='0.5s'/> Monitoring Activities: Ongoing evaluations to ensure controls are present and functioning. <break time='1s'/> Memory aid for the five components: CRIME. Control environment, Risk assessment, Information and communication, Monitoring, control Event activities. Or just remember the first letters: C-R-C-I-M. <break time='1s'/> COSO ERM takes a broader view, integrating risk management with strategy and performance. It emphasizes that risk is not just about avoiding bad outcomes but also about enabling value creation. <break time='0.8s'/> Key concept: Risk appetite is the amount of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives. Risk tolerance is the acceptable variation around specific objectives. <break time='0.8s'/> As an auditor evaluating risk management, you assess whether the organization has a defined risk appetite, whether risks are systematically identified and assessed, whether risk responses are appropriate, and whether monitoring exists to track risk levels and control effectiveness. <break time='0.5s'/> The exam expects you to recognize when an organization's risk management practices are inadequate and to identify which component of the framework is missing."
CISA-D2-CO-01,IT Strategy and Business Alignment,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,10,concept,"One of the most critical governance issues is whether IT strategy aligns with business strategy. Let's understand what alignment means and how to audit it. <break time='1s'/> Business alignment means IT investments, priorities, and activities support the organization's business objectives. IT shouldn't pursue technology for technology's sake. Every initiative should have a clear business justification. <break time='0.8s'/> Signs of good alignment: The IT strategic plan explicitly references business objectives. IT investments are prioritized based on business value. Business leaders are involved in IT steering committees. IT performance metrics connect to business outcomes. <break time='0.8s'/> Signs of poor alignment: IT projects that nobody asked for. Business complaining that IT doesn't understand their needs. No IT representation in business planning. Technology decisions made in isolation from business strategy. <break time='1s'/> How do you audit alignment? <break time='0.5s'/> First, obtain the business strategic plan and the IT strategic plan. Read them. Do they reference each other? Can you trace IT initiatives to business objectives? <break time='0.5s'/> Second, interview business executives. Do they feel IT supports their priorities? Do they understand IT's direction? <break time='0.5s'/> Third, review IT governance structures. Is there a steering committee? Who's on it? Do they meet regularly? Who approves IT investments? <break time='0.5s'/> Fourth, examine IT investment decisions. What criteria are used? Is business value assessed? How are projects prioritized? <break time='1s'/> Exam scenario: You discover IT is spending millions on infrastructure upgrades, but no business case exists and business leaders are unaware. What's the finding? IT investments are not aligned with business strategy and lack proper governance approval. <break time='0.5s'/> The recommendation: Establish an IT steering committee with business representation and require business case justification for all significant IT investments."
CISA-D2-CO-02,Third Party Risk and Vendor Management,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,10,concept,"Organizations increasingly rely on third parties: cloud providers, outsourcers, software vendors, contractors. Every third party relationship introduces risk that must be managed. <break time='1s'/> Third-party risk includes several categories. <break time='0.5s'/> Operational risk: The vendor might fail to deliver services as expected, causing business disruption. <break time='0.5s'/> Security risk: The vendor might have weak security, exposing your data or systems. <break time='0.5s'/> Compliance risk: The vendor's practices might not meet your regulatory requirements, and you're still accountable. <break time='0.5s'/> Financial risk: The vendor might have financial troubles and go out of business. <break time='0.5s'/> Reputational risk: The vendor's problems become your problems in the eyes of customers and regulators. <break time='1s'/> What controls should exist? <break time='0.8s'/> Due diligence before engagement. Assess the vendor's security practices, financial stability, reputation, and capabilities before signing a contract. <break time='0.8s'/> Contractual protections. The contract should specify security requirements, audit rights, data handling obligations, service levels, and termination provisions. <break time='0.8s'/> Ongoing monitoring. Regularly assess vendor performance against contracts. Request SOC reports, conduct periodic audits, and monitor security posture. <break time='0.8s'/> Exit strategy. Have a plan for what happens if you need to end the relationship. How do you get your data back? How do you transition services? <break time='1s'/> Exam tip: A question might describe a data breach at a vendor resulting in exposure of customer information. Who is responsible? You are. You can outsource the work, but you cannot outsource the accountability. <break time='0.5s'/> The auditor's role: Assess whether third-party risk is properly identified, contracts include appropriate protections, and ongoing monitoring exists."
CISA-D2-SC-01,Scenario: Assessing IT Governance Maturity,Kristin_public_3_20240108,en-US-JennyNeural,15,scenario,"The board of directors is concerned about IT governance. They've asked for an assessment because they keep hearing about strategic misalignment, budget overruns, and security gaps. Your job: evaluate the maturity of IT governance and provide recommendations. <break time='1s'/> Where do you start? <break time='0.5s'/> You begin by understanding the governance structures. Who's responsible for IT oversight? Is there an IT steering committee? Who's on it? How often do they meet? What decisions do they make? <break time='0.5s'/> You request the IT charter, committee meeting minutes, and strategic planning documents. <break time='1s'/> You discover: There's an IT steering committee, but it hasn't met in eight months. Membership includes the CIO and IT directors, but no business executives. There's no formal IT strategic plan. Large projects are approved informally by whoever has budget authority. <break time='0.5s'/> Already you're seeing gaps. Let's dig deeper. <break time='1s'/> You look at policy and frameworks. Does the organization reference any governance frameworks? Do policies exist for IT investment decisions, risk management, and performance measurement? <break time='0.5s'/> You find: policies exist but are outdated. They reference COBIT, but nobody seems to know what that means in practice. There's no formal IT risk register. Performance metrics exist for uptime and ticket resolution, but nothing linking IT to business outcomes. <break time='1s'/> You interview key stakeholders. The CIO says she doesn't have time for committees and just needs to keep things running. The CFO says he doesn't understand IT spending and doesn't know if it's delivering value. Business unit leaders say IT doesn't understand their priorities. <break time='0.8s'/> Now you assess maturity. Using a framework like COBIT's capability model, you rate each governance area from zero, meaning non-existent, to five, meaning optimized. <break time='0.5s'/> Your assessment: IT strategic planning is at level one, ad hoc. IT oversight is at level two, basic and inconsistent. IT risk management is at level one. Value delivery measurement is at level one. <break time='1s'/> Your recommendations: Re-establish the steering committee with mandatory business representation. Develop an IT strategic plan aligned with business strategy. Implement a formal IT risk management process. Define business-outcome-oriented metrics. <break time='0.5s'/> You present to the board with a roadmap for moving from current state to a target maturity level of three within eighteen months."
