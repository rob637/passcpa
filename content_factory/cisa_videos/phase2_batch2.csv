CISA-D3-CP-01,Agile vs Waterfall Audit Considerations,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,10,comparison,"Waterfall and Agile are fundamentally different development approaches, and they require different audit strategies. Let's understand both. <break time='1s'/> Waterfall is sequential. Requirements are gathered upfront, then design, then development, then testing, then implementation. Each phase completes before the next begins. Documentation is extensive. Change is expensive. <break time='0.8s'/> Agile is iterative. Work happens in short cycles called sprints, typically two to four weeks. Requirements emerge and evolve. Working software is delivered frequently. Change is embraced. <break time='1s'/> From an audit perspective, each approach has different risks. <break time='0.8s'/> Waterfall risks: Requirements might be wrong because they were locked in too early. Testing might be rushed because development took too long. There's a big bang implementation that could fail catastrophically. <break time='0.8s'/> Agile risks: Documentation might be inadequate because the focus is on working software over comprehensive documentation. Changes might not be properly controlled because the methodology embraces change. User stories might lack sufficient detail for compliance requirements. <break time='1s'/> How do you audit each? <break time='0.5s'/> For Waterfall, you review phase gate approvals, design documents, and test plans. You verify that each phase was properly completed and approved before proceeding. <break time='0.5s'/> For Agile, you review the product backlog, sprint ceremonies, and definition of done. You verify that user stories include security and compliance requirements, that testing occurs each sprint, and that changes are still controlled even if rapid. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam point: Don't assume Agile means no controls. Good Agile still has controls. They're just embedded in the process differently. Security requirements should be in user stories. Testing happens continuously. Change control is through backlog management and sprint planning."
CISA-D3-CO-02,Testing Types From Unit to UAT,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,12,concept,"Software testing follows a progression. Each type serves a different purpose, and skipping stages introduces risk. Let's walk through them. <break time='1s'/> Unit testing is first. Developers test individual components or modules in isolation. Does this single function work as coded? Unit tests are automated, run frequently, and catch basic coding errors early. <break time='0.8s'/> Integration testing comes next. You combine components and test that they work together. Module A passes data to Module B. Does the interface work? Do the components integrate correctly? Integration testing catches interface problems and data passing issues. <break time='0.8s'/> System testing tests the complete system as a whole. Does the entire application function correctly from end to end? This includes functional testing against requirements, performance testing under load, and security testing for vulnerabilities. <break time='0.8s'/> User acceptance testing, or UAT, is performed by actual business users. Does the system meet business needs? Can users accomplish their real-world tasks? UAT validates that we built the right thing, not just that we built it right. <break time='1s'/> Regression testing is performed whenever changes are made. It verifies that new changes haven't broken existing functionality. You re-run previous tests to ensure the system still works as it did before. <break time='1s'/> Who performs each type? <break time='0.5s'/> Developers do unit and often integration testing. Independent QA teams do system testing. Business users do UAT. This segregation of duties is important because developers might miss their own errors. <break time='0.8s'/> Exam scenarios often involve testing being skipped or performed improperly. If UAT is skipped, the risk is that the system doesn't meet business needs. If regression testing is skipped, the risk is that changes introduce new defects. <break time='0.5s'/> The auditor verifies that testing is performed at each level by appropriate personnel with documented results."
CISA-D3-CO-03,Data Migration and Conversion Controls,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,10,concept,"Moving data from an old system to a new system is risky. Without proper controls, you can lose data, corrupt data, or end up with two versions of the truth. <break time='1s'/> Why is migration risky? <break time='0.5s'/> Data formats might differ between systems. A field that was thirty characters becomes twenty. Data gets truncated. <break time='0.5s'/> Business rules might differ. The old system allowed certain values that the new system rejects. <break time='0.5s'/> Data volumes are large. A single error in the migration script could affect millions of records. <break time='0.5s'/> Timing is critical. During migration, which system is the source of truth? <break time='1s'/> What controls should exist? <break time='0.8s'/> Data mapping documentation. Every field in the old system should map to a field in the new system, with transformation rules documented. <break time='0.8s'/> Data cleansing before migration. Clean up bad data in the old system before migrating. Garbage in, garbage out. <break time='0.8s'/> Migration testing. Run the migration in a test environment. Verify record counts, validate data values, and check edge cases. <break time='0.8s'/> Reconciliation after migration. Compare totals, samples, and critical records between old and new systems. Do the numbers match? <break time='0.8s'/> Rollback plan. What if migration fails? Can you restore the old system and try again? <break time='1s'/> Exam application: A question describes data discrepancies after a system migration. What control was likely missing? Data reconciliation. The organization should have verified that the data migrated completely and accurately before decommissioning the old system."
CISA-D3-CO-04,Change Management for IS Auditors,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,12,concept,"Change management is one of the most frequently audited IT controls, and it appears constantly on the CISA exam. Let's master it. <break time='1s'/> The core principle: All changes to production systems should be requested, assessed, approved, tested, and documented before implementation. <break time='0.5s'/> Unauthorized changes introduce risk. They might contain errors that cause outages. They might introduce security vulnerabilities. They might conflict with other changes. They complicate troubleshooting when problems occur. <break time='1s'/> The change management process has key stages. <break time='0.8s'/> Change request: Someone submits a formal request describing what they want to change and why. <break time='0.8s'/> Impact assessment: Technical staff assess the risk, dependencies, and resources required. What could go wrong? What systems are affected? <break time='0.8s'/> Approval: An appropriate authority reviews and approves. For high-risk changes, this might be a Change Advisory Board. For routine changes, a manager might approve. <break time='0.8s'/> Testing: The change is tested in a non-production environment. Does it work? Does it break anything else? <break time='0.8s'/> Implementation: The change is deployed to production during an approved window. <break time='0.8s'/> Post-implementation review: Verify the change worked as expected. Close the change record. <break time='1s'/> What about emergencies? <break time='0.5s'/> Emergency changes are allowed, but they're not exemptions from control. The change should still be logged, approved by an authorized manager even if after hours, tested as much as possible, and documented. Retroactive review should occur within a defined timeframe. <break time='1s'/> As an auditor, you sample completed changes and trace them through the process. Did a request exist? Was it approved before implementation? Was testing performed? Is there documentation? <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: Changes implemented without approval, testing bypassed, documentation incomplete."
CISA-D3-SC-01,Scenario: Auditing a System Implementation,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,15,scenario,"The organization just implemented a new financial system three weeks ago. Shortly after go-live, users started reporting problems: duplicate transactions, missing data, and performance issues. Management wants to know what went wrong. You're conducting a post-implementation audit. <break time='1s'/> You start by gathering information. <break time='0.5s'/> You request the project documentation: business case, requirements specification, design documents, test plans, test results, go-live checklist, and any incident tickets since implementation. <break time='1s'/> What you find is concerning. <break time='0.5s'/> The business case exists but was developed two years ago. Requirements were never formally signed off by users. There's a design document, but it's marked 'draft.' Test results show that UAT was planned for four weeks but completed in one week with several critical defects marked 'deferred.' The go-live decision was made by IT without formal business approval. <break time='1s'/> You conduct interviews. <break time='0.5s'/> The project manager says they were under executive pressure to meet a hard deadline. Testing was compressed when development ran late. The finance team lead says she raised concerns about readiness but was told go-live wasn't optional. The IT director says he believed the system was ready enough and deferred defects were minor. <break time='1s'/> Now you analyze root causes. <break time='0.5s'/> The duplicate transactions trace to a data migration defect that was known but deferred. The missing data stems from incomplete field mapping that wasn't caught because testing was compressed. Performance issues result from inadequate capacity planning. <break time='0.8s'/> You identify control failures: Insufficient UAT because of schedule pressure. No formal go-live approval process. Known defects not properly assessed for go-live risk. Data migration reconciliation incomplete. <break time='1s'/> Your recommendations: For immediate actions, prioritize fixing the critical defects. For process improvements, establish formal go-live criteria that cannot be waived without executive risk acceptance, ensure adequate testing time in future projects, require data migration reconciliation sign-off before go-live, and implement formal business approval for production deployment. <break time='0.5s'/> You present your findings. Management accepts responsibility and commits to remediation."
CISA-D4-CO-02,IT Operations Management Controls,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,12,concept,"IT operations keeps everything running day to day. As auditors, we need to understand the key control areas that prevent operational failures. <break time='1s'/> Let's cover the major areas. <break time='0.8s'/> Data center controls: Physical security limits access to authorized personnel. Environmental controls manage temperature, humidity, and fire suppression. Power redundancy through UPS and generators prevents outages during power failures. <break time='0.8s'/> Job scheduling: Batch processes run according to defined schedules. Job scheduling software manages dependencies between jobs. What happens if a job fails? There should be automated alerts and documented restart procedures. <break time='0.8s'/> Operator procedures: Documented procedures exist for routine tasks and exception handling. Operators shouldn't be making it up as they go. <break time='0.8s'/> Monitoring: Systems are continuously monitored for availability, performance, and capacity. Alerts trigger when thresholds are exceeded. Someone responds to those alerts. <break time='1s'/> Segregation of duties in operations is critical. <break time='0.5s'/> Operators should not have access to make unauthorized program changes. Developers should not have unsupervised access to production. System administrators should not process business transactions. <break time='0.5s'/> These separations prevent a single person from introducing errors or committing fraud undetected. <break time='1s'/> Common audit findings in operations: Excessive access privileges, typically everyone is an administrator. Alert fatigue where too many alerts leads to important ones being ignored. Undocumented manual processes where critical steps live in one person's head. Configuration drift where production systems differ from documented standards. <break time='0.5s'/> Your role as auditor: verify that documented procedures exist, are current, and are followed."
CISA-D4-CO-03,Incident and Problem Management,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,12,concept,"Incident and problem management are related but distinct processes. Understanding the difference is crucial for the exam. <break time='1s'/> An incident is an unplanned interruption to a service or a reduction in quality. Examples: The email server is down. The application is running slowly. Users cannot log in. <break time='0.5s'/> The goal of incident management is to restore normal service as quickly as possible while minimizing business impact. Speed is the priority. Getting users back to work matters more than understanding why it broke. <break time='1s'/> A problem is the underlying cause of one or more incidents. Examples: The server keeps crashing because of a memory leak. Logins fail during peak hours because of an undersized authentication server. <break time='0.5s'/> The goal of problem management is to identify root causes and prevent incidents from recurring. It's proactive and investigative. <break time='1s'/> Here's the workflow. <break time='0.5s'/> An incident occurs. Incident management springs into action. They diagnose quickly, apply a workaround if needed, and restore service. They log the incident and close it. <break time='0.5s'/> If the incident is serious or keeps happening, problem management opens a problem record. They investigate root cause, identify a permanent fix, and track implementation. The problem remains open until the fix is verified effective. <break time='1s'/> Key exam concept: A workaround is not a solution. Incident management might apply a workaround to restore service, like restarting the server every night to clear the memory leak. But the problem isn't solved until the memory leak is fixed. <break time='0.8s'/> Audit focus: Are incidents logged and categorized? Are major incidents analyzed for root cause? Are problems tracked to resolution? Are workarounds documented with problem tickets?"
CISA-D4-CO-04,Data Center Physical Security,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,12,concept,"Cybersecurity gets all the attention, but physical security failures can be just as devastating. If someone can walk into your data center, all your network security is irrelevant. <break time='1s'/> Let's cover the layers of physical security. <break time='0.8s'/> Perimeter security: This is the outer boundary. Fencing, walls, security guards, vehicle barriers. The goal is deterrence and delay. Make it hard to get close to the building. <break time='0.8s'/> Building access: Locked doors, access card readers, visitor management. Only authorized personnel should enter. Visitors should be logged and escorted. <break time='0.8s'/> Data center access: Within the building, the data center has additional restrictions. Separate access controls, possibly biometric authentication, mantrap entries that prevent tailgating, and video surveillance. <break time='0.8s'/> Rack and device access: High-security environments may lock individual racks. Console access to servers is controlled separately from remote access. <break time='1s'/> Environmental controls protect against non-human threats. <break time='0.5s'/> Temperature and humidity: Servers generate heat. Precision cooling systems maintain optimal conditions. Humidity must be controlled because too low causes static discharge and too high causes condensation. <break time='0.5s'/> Fire suppression: Data centers use clean agent suppression systems that don't damage equipment, unlike water sprinklers. Detection systems include smoke detectors and very early smoke detection apparatus, or VESDA. <break time='0.5s'/> Water detection: Sensors detect leaks before flooding occurs. <break time='0.5s'/> Power protection: Uninterruptible power supplies handle brief outages. Generators provide extended backup power. Power conditioning protects against surges and sags. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Tour the facility. Observe controls in action. Test access controls. Review visitor logs. Verify environmental monitoring. Check maintenance records for fire suppression systems."
