CISA-D4-FW-02,ITIL Service Operations,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,12,framework,"ITIL is the most widely adopted framework for IT service management, and service operations is where IT delivers value day to day. Let's understand the key processes. <break time='1s'/> Service operations has five key processes, and four of them appear frequently on the CISA exam. <break time='0.8s'/> Incident management we've discussed. Restore service quickly. Minimize business impact. The metrics here are mean time to resolve and first call resolution rate. <break time='0.8s'/> Problem management we've also covered. Find root causes. Prevent recurrence. The key artifact is the known error database, which documents problems and their workarounds. <break time='1s'/> Event management is about monitoring and filtering. An event is any change in state that has significance. A server boots? Event. Disk usage hits ninety percent? Event. A user logs in? Event. <break time='0.5s'/> Not all events require action. Event management filters events into three categories: informational, warning, and exception. Only exceptions require immediate response. Good event management prevents alert fatigue. <break time='1s'/> Access management is about granting rights to use services. This implements the policies defined by information security. It's the execution layer. When a new employee starts, access management provisions their accounts according to their role. <break time='0.5s'/> Key principle: access management doesn't decide who gets what access. That's defined elsewhere. Access management just executes those decisions correctly and maintains records. <break time='1s'/> The service desk is the function, not a process. It's the single point of contact between IT and users. All incidents come through the service desk. They log, categorize, prioritize, and either resolve or escalate. <break time='0.5s'/> Exam tip: ITIL distinguishes between processes, which are what you do, and functions, which are who does it. Service desk is a function that executes multiple processes."
CISA-D4-SC-01,Scenario: Investigating a System Outage,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,14,scenario,"The organization's primary business application went down Friday afternoon and wasn't restored until Saturday morning. Customers couldn't place orders for eighteen hours. The CEO wants to know what happened and how to prevent it from happening again. You're conducting a post-incident review. <break time='1s'/> You gather the facts. <break time='0.5s'/> The incident started at 3:47 PM when the application became unresponsive. Users reported errors. The service desk logged the incident at 3:52 PM. Initial diagnosis suggested a database problem. The DBA was contacted at 4:15 PM but was traveling and had limited connectivity. An alternate DBA wasn't available. <break time='0.5s'/> By 6:00 PM, they identified a database table lock caused by a long-running query. But the person who could cancel the query without data corruption wasn't reachable. At 11:30 PM, they reached him by phone. The query was cancelled at 11:45 PM, but the database required recovery procedures. Service was restored at 2:15 AM. <break time='1s'/> You analyze what went wrong at each stage. <break time='0.5s'/> Detection was reasonable. Five minute gap between incident and report is acceptable. <break time='0.5s'/> Escalation was slow. Thirty minutes to reach the DBA, and the backup DBA wasn't available. The escalation procedures didn't identify alternates. <break time='0.5s'/> Resolution was delayed by single points of knowledge. Only one person could safely cancel the query. That knowledge should be documented or others should be trained. <break time='0.5s'/> The root cause was the long-running query itself. Why was a query that could lock the entire application running during business hours? <break time='1s'/> Your findings point to control gaps. <break time='0.5s'/> Escalation procedures were incomplete. They named primary contacts but not alternates. <break time='0.5s'/> Knowledge management was inadequate. Critical procedures were not documented. <break time='0.5s'/> Change management might have failed. Who approved running that query during business hours? Was it even submitted as a change? <break time='0.5s'/> The organization lacked adequate redundancy in staffing and knowledge. <break time='1s'/> Your recommendations: Update escalation procedures with backup contacts and emergency contact methods. Document critical procedures so that more than one person can perform them. Review change management to ensure long-running queries are scheduled appropriately. Consider implementing query timeout controls. <break time='0.5s'/> This scenario illustrates how multiple small weaknesses combine into a major incident."
CISA-D5-CO-01,Defense in Depth Architecture,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,12,concept,"Defense in depth is the fundamental architecture of information security. If one control fails, others still protect you. No single point of failure. <break time='1s'/> Think of it like a castle. Multiple walls, a moat, guards, and a keep. Attackers have to breach multiple defenses. Each layer slows them down and provides detection opportunities. <break time='0.8s'/> In information security, we implement multiple layers. <break time='0.8s'/> Network perimeter: Firewalls filter traffic between networks. Intrusion prevention systems block known attack patterns. Demilitarized zones isolate public-facing services. <break time='0.8s'/> Network interior: Segmentation limits lateral movement. Internal firewalls protect sensitive zones. Network monitoring detects anomalies. <break time='0.8s'/> Host layer: Operating system hardening removes unnecessary services. Endpoint protection detects malware. Application whitelisting limits what can execute. <break time='0.8s'/> Application layer: Secure coding practices prevent vulnerabilities. Input validation stops injection attacks. Authentication and authorization control access. <break time='0.8s'/> Data layer: Encryption protects data at rest and in transit. Access controls limit who can see what. Data loss prevention monitors for exfiltration. <break time='1s'/> People layer: Security awareness training reduces human error. Policies establish expectations. Background checks verify trust. <break time='1s'/> A sophisticated attacker might bypass one layer. Maybe they phish an employee and get credentials to bypass network controls. But they still face internal segmentation, endpoint protection, application controls, and data encryption. <break time='0.5s'/> Exam tip: When evaluating controls, consider what happens if each one fails. Are there other controls that compensate? Defense in depth means yes."
CISA-D5-CO-02,Encryption Fundamentals for IS Auditors,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,14,concept,"Encryption appears constantly on the CISA exam. Let's build a solid foundation. <break time='1s'/> Encryption transforms readable data, called plaintext, into unreadable data, called ciphertext, using a key and an algorithm. Only someone with the correct key can decrypt back to plaintext. <break time='0.8s'/> There are two fundamental types of encryption. <break time='1s'/> Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It's fast and efficient. Examples include AES, which is the current standard, and older algorithms like DES and 3DES. <break time='0.5s'/> The challenge: How do you securely share the key? If you send the key over the same channel as the encrypted data, an attacker could intercept both. <break time='1s'/> Asymmetric encryption uses a key pair: a public key and a private key. Data encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. You can freely share your public key. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples include RSA and elliptic curve cryptography. Asymmetric encryption is slower but solves the key distribution problem. <break time='1s'/> In practice, systems often combine both. Asymmetric encryption securely exchanges a symmetric key, then symmetric encryption handles the actual data because it's faster. This is called hybrid encryption and it's how HTTPS works. <break time='1s'/> Hash functions are related but different. A hash takes any input and produces a fixed-size output called a digest. It's one-way. You can't reverse a hash to get the original input. <break time='0.5s'/> Hashes verify integrity. If you hash a file and later hash it again, the same output means the file hasn't changed. Different output means something changed. <break time='0.5s'/> Common hash algorithms: SHA-256 is current best practice. MD5 and SHA-1 are deprecated due to collision vulnerabilities. <break time='1s'/> Exam application: Know that symmetric is faster, asymmetric solves key exchange, and hashing ensures integrity. Know the current standards: AES for symmetric, RSA or ECC for asymmetric, SHA-256 for hashing."
CISA-D5-CO-03,Access Control Models,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,12,concept,"Access control determines who can access what and how. There are several models, each with different characteristics. <break time='1s'/> Discretionary Access Control, or DAC. The resource owner decides who can access, like sharing a file and choosing which coworkers can edit. It's flexible but inconsistent. Security depends on each owner making good decisions. Most personal computers and file shares use DAC. <break time='1s'/> Mandatory Access Control, or MAC. A central authority defines access based on labels. Users have clearance levels. Resources have classification levels. You can only access resources at or below your clearance. <break time='0.5s'/> MAC is rigid but very secure. It's used in military and government systems. Users cannot change access rights, even on their own resources. <break time='1s'/> Role-Based Access Control, or RBAC. Access is based on job function. You create roles like 'accounts payable clerk' with specific permissions. When someone gets that job, they get that role. When they change jobs, the role changes. <break time='0.5s'/> RBAC is the most common model in enterprises. It's manageable at scale and aligns with organizational structure. <break time='1s'/> Attribute-Based Access Control, or ABAC. Access decisions consider multiple attributes: who is requesting, what are they requesting, from where, when, and why. <break time='0.5s'/> For example: Allow access to financial reports if the user is in the finance department, accessing from a corporate device, during business hours, in the same country as the data. <break time='0.5s'/> ABAC is flexible and granular but complex to implement. <break time='1s'/> Exam tip: When a question describes access control characteristics, match them to the model. Owner-controlled means DAC. Clearance and classification means MAC. Job function means RBAC. Multiple attributes and conditions mean ABAC."
CISA-D5-FW-02,Security Governance and Policy Framework,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,12,framework,"Effective security requires governance. Governance provides direction, ensures objectives are achieved, and manages risk appropriately. <break time='1s'/> The governance structure starts at the top. <break time='0.5s'/> The board of directors has ultimate accountability for security. They set risk appetite and approve major policies. <break time='0.5s'/> Executive management implements the board's direction. The CEO is typically accountable for overall security. A Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO, leads the security function. <break time='0.5s'/> Security management develops and implements the security program. They create policies, manage risks, and oversee controls. <break time='1s'/> The policy framework has a hierarchy. <break time='0.8s'/> Policies are high-level statements of management intent. They state what must be done but not how. Example: All sensitive data must be protected from unauthorized access. Policies require executive approval and rarely change. <break time='0.8s'/> Standards define specific requirements. They state what specifically must be implemented. Example: All passwords must be at least twelve characters. Standards provide measurable requirements. <break time='0.8s'/> Procedures are step-by-step instructions for how to do something. Example: To reset a password, verify identity using two of three authentication questions, then generate a temporary password, and then force change on first login. <break time='0.8s'/> Guidelines are recommendations and best practices. They're not mandatory. Example: Consider using a password manager to maintain unique passwords for each system. <break time='1s'/> Exam distinction: Policies govern behavior. Standards mandate specifics. Procedures instruct actions. Guidelines suggest approaches. <break time='0.5s'/> As an auditor, you verify that policies exist, are approved, are communicated, and are followed. You check that standards are implemented and procedures are current."
CISA-D5-SC-01,Scenario: Investigating a Security Breach,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,15,scenario,"The organization discovered customer credit card numbers posted on a hacking forum. Management suspects a breach. You're part of the incident response team, and your role is to assess what happened and identify control failures. <break time='1s'/> The investigation reveals a timeline. <break time='0.5s'/> Three months ago, an attacker sent phishing emails to multiple employees. One employee clicked and entered credentials on a fake login page. <break time='0.5s'/> Using those credentials, the attacker accessed the employee's email and found emails containing server credentials. Internal teams had been emailing passwords. <break time='0.5s'/> The attacker used those credentials to access a database server. The account had excessive privileges. It was a generic shared account used by multiple developers. <break time='0.5s'/> The database contained credit card numbers stored in plain text. There was no encryption at rest. <break time='0.5s'/> The attacker exported the data over several weeks. There was no data loss prevention monitoring. Normal database queries didn't trigger alerts. <break time='0.5s'/> The breach was discovered only when the data appeared publicly. <break time='1s'/> You identify multiple control failures at each stage. <break time='0.8s'/> Prevention failures: Security awareness training apparently didn't prevent the phishing success. Email security didn't detect the phishing message. Multifactor authentication wasn't implemented, so stolen credentials were sufficient. <break time='0.8s'/> Access control failures: Credentials were shared via email, violating basic security practices. The database account was shared rather than individual. The account had excessive privileges beyond what was needed. <break time='0.8s'/> Data protection failures: Credit card numbers were stored unencrypted, violating PCI DSS requirements. No data masking or tokenization was implemented. <break time='0.8s'/> Detection failures: No monitoring detected the initial access or ongoing exfiltration. The organization learned of the breach from external sources. <break time='1s'/> Your recommendations address each layer: Implement multifactor authentication. Deploy phishing-resistant security awareness training. Eliminate shared accounts. Implement least privilege access. Encrypt sensitive data at rest. Deploy data loss prevention. Implement security monitoring with alerting. <break time='0.5s'/> This scenario shows how multiple control weaknesses chain together into a catastrophic breach."
