CISA-D5-CO-04,Network Security Controls,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,12,concept,"Network security controls protect data in motion and control access between systems. Let's cover the key technologies. <break time='1s'/> Firewalls are the primary network boundary control. They examine traffic and allow or deny based on rules. <break time='0.5s'/> Packet filtering firewalls examine headers: source and destination IP, port numbers, and protocol. They're fast but limited. They can't see inside the packet. <break time='0.5s'/> Stateful inspection firewalls track connection state. They understand that a response packet relates to an earlier request. More intelligent but still limited to headers. <break time='0.5s'/> Application layer firewalls, also called next-generation firewalls, inspect content. They can block specific applications, scan for malware, and enforce policies based on user identity. <break time='1s'/> Intrusion Detection Systems, or IDS, monitor traffic for malicious activity. They detect and alert but don't block. Think of them as security cameras. <break time='0.5s'/> Intrusion Prevention Systems, or IPS, detect and actively block threats. They sit inline and can drop malicious traffic in real time. <break time='0.5s'/> Detection methods include signature-based, which matches known attack patterns, and anomaly-based, which detects deviations from normal behavior. Signature-based has fewer false positives but misses new attacks. Anomaly-based catches new attacks but has more false positives. <break time='1s'/> Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, create encrypted tunnels over untrusted networks. Remote workers connect via VPN to access corporate resources securely over the internet. Site-to-site VPNs connect entire offices. <break time='0.8s'/> Network segmentation limits lateral movement. Instead of one flat network, you create zones. The payment processing zone can't reach the development zone. If attackers breach one zone, segmentation contains them. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit focus: Review firewall rules for appropriateness. Verify IDS/IPS is monitored and alerts are investigated. Check VPN configurations and access logs. Evaluate segmentation strategy."
CISA-D5-CO-05,Logging Monitoring and SIEM,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,12,concept,"If you can't see what's happening, you can't protect it. Logging and monitoring are foundational security controls. <break time='1s'/> What should be logged? <break time='0.5s'/> Authentication events: successful and failed logins, password changes, account lockouts. <break time='0.5s'/> Authorization events: access granted, access denied, privilege changes. <break time='0.5s'/> System events: startup, shutdown, configuration changes, errors. <break time='0.5s'/> Application events: transactions processed, data accessed, errors encountered. <break time='0.5s'/> Security events: firewall blocks, malware detections, intrusion alerts. <break time='1s'/> Logs must be protected. Attackers often try to modify or delete logs to cover their tracks. Store logs on separate systems. Use write-once media or append-only configurations. Implement access controls so only security personnel can access logs. <break time='1s'/> Retention matters. How long do you keep logs? Regulatory requirements may mandate minimum periods. Investigation needs require enough history to trace an incident. Common retention periods range from 90 days to seven years depending on log type and requirements. <break time='1s'/> SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management. A SIEM collects logs from across the environment, normalizes them into a common format, correlates events across sources, and generates alerts based on rules. <break time='0.5s'/> For example, twenty failed logins on different systems from the same source IP within one minute triggers an alert for potential brute force attack. Neither log alone shows the pattern. The SIEM sees it by correlating events. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Verify logging is enabled and covers required events. Check log retention meets requirements. Confirm logs are protected from tampering. Review SIEM alert rules and response procedures."
CISA-D5-CP-01,Preventive vs Detective vs Corrective Controls,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,10,comparison,"Understanding control types is fundamental to IS auditing. Controls are classified by when they operate relative to an incident. <break time='1s'/> Preventive controls stop incidents before they occur. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: Firewalls blocking malicious traffic. Access controls preventing unauthorized users from entering. Input validation rejecting invalid data. Security training preventing employees from falling for phishing. <break time='0.5s'/> Preventive controls are the first line of defense. They're ideal because they prevent harm entirely. But no preventive control is perfect, so we need other types. <break time='1s'/> Detective controls identify incidents that have occurred or are occurring. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: Security monitoring detecting unusual activity. Log review finding unauthorized access. Reconciliations identifying discrepancies. Audit trails recording who did what. <break time='0.5s'/> Detective controls assume prevention will sometimes fail. They minimize damage by identifying incidents quickly. The faster you detect, the less damage occurs. <break time='1s'/> Corrective controls address incidents after detection. <break time='0.5s'/> Examples: Incident response procedures containing a breach. Backup restoration recovering lost data. Patches fixing vulnerabilities. Disciplinary actions addressing policy violations. <break time='0.5s'/> Corrective controls limit damage and restore normal operations. <break time='1s'/> Compensating controls substitute when primary controls can't be implemented. <break time='0.5s'/> Example: You can't implement multifactor authentication on a legacy system. As compensation, you implement enhanced monitoring, restrict network access, and require password changes every thirty days. Compensating controls should address the same risk, provide similar assurance, and not introduce new risks. <break time='1s'/> Exam application: When asked which control type is most effective, preventive is usually the answer because preventing harm is better than detecting or correcting it."
CISA-D3-FW-02,System Development Life Cycle Phases,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,14,framework,"The System Development Life Cycle, or SDLC, provides structure to building information systems. Auditors must understand each phase and its control objectives. <break time='1s'/> Phase one is planning and feasibility. <break time='0.5s'/> What problem are we solving? Is a new system the right solution? The business case documents the need, costs, benefits, and alternatives. A feasibility study assesses technical, economic, and operational feasibility. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Was proper analysis done? Were alternatives considered? Did appropriate management approve proceeding? <break time='1s'/> Phase two is requirements definition. <break time='0.5s'/> What must the system do? Gather requirements from stakeholders. Document functional requirements, which describe what the system does, and non-functional requirements, which describe how well it performs. Requirements should be specific, measurable, and testable. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Did business users participate? Are requirements documented and signed off? <break time='1s'/> Phase three is design. <break time='0.5s'/> How will the system work? Logical design describes what the system will do. Physical design describes the technical implementation. Design documents should trace back to requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Does design address all requirements? Were security and control requirements included from the start? <break time='1s'/> Phase four is development or acquisition. <break time='0.5s'/> Build or buy the system. For custom development, programmers write code following design specifications. For purchased software, you evaluate vendors and configure the package. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Were coding standards followed? Was a build-or-buy analysis conducted? <break time='1s'/> Phase five is testing. <break time='0.5s'/> Does the system work correctly? Multiple test types at multiple levels ensure quality. We covered testing types in a previous video. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Was testing adequate? Were defects tracked and resolved? <break time='1s'/> Phase six is implementation. <break time='0.5s'/> Deploy the system. Train users. Migrate data. Go live. Implementation approaches include parallel, where old and new run simultaneously; phased, where you deploy to groups over time; pilot, where you deploy to one location first; and big bang, where you cut over completely at once. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit concern: Was implementation properly approved? Were users trained? Was data migration verified? <break time='1s'/> Phase seven is operations and maintenance. <break time='0.5s'/> Run and support the system. Fix bugs. Apply patches. Enhance functionality over time. Most system costs occur in this phase. <break time='0.5s'/> Eventually, the system reaches end of life and is replaced, restarting the cycle."
CISA-D3-CO-05,Application Controls Overview,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,12,concept,"Application controls are embedded in business applications to ensure data integrity and proper processing. They complement general IT controls. <break time='1s'/> Application controls fall into three categories based on where they operate. <break time='0.8s'/> Input controls ensure data entering the system is accurate, complete, and authorized. <break time='0.5s'/> Data validation checks that data meets defined formats and rules. Is the date valid? Is the account number the right length? Is the quantity numeric? <break time='0.5s'/> Range checks verify values fall within acceptable limits. An hourly wage of one thousand dollars would fail a range check. <break time='0.5s'/> Reasonableness checks compare values to expected norms. An order for one million units might be questioned. <break time='0.5s'/> Authorization controls ensure only approved transactions enter the system. Transactions above certain amounts require additional approval. <break time='1s'/> Processing controls ensure data is processed accurately and completely. <break time='0.5s'/> Run-to-run totals track totals from one processing step to the next to ensure nothing is lost or added. <break time='0.5s'/> Control totals track hash totals, record counts, and financial totals through processing. <break time='0.5s'/> Exception reporting identifies items that couldn't be processed normally for manual review. <break time='1s'/> Output controls ensure results are accurate, complete, and distributed appropriately. <break time='0.5s'/> Report distribution lists define who receives what reports. <break time='0.5s'/> Output reconciliation compares totals to input and processing totals. <break time='0.5s'/> Report review requires users to review output for reasonableness. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Document the application. Identify key controls at each stage. Test that controls operate effectively. Trace transactions from input through processing to output."
CISA-D4-CO-05,Capacity and Performance Management,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,10,concept,"Systems must have adequate capacity to meet current and future demand. Performance management ensures they meet user expectations. <break time='1s'/> Capacity management has three sub-processes. <break time='0.8s'/> Business capacity management understands future business needs. If the company plans to double sales, systems need to handle double the transactions. <break time='0.8s'/> Service capacity management ensures services meet defined targets. Service level agreements might promise 99.9% availability and sub-second response time. <break time='0.8s'/> Component capacity management monitors infrastructure components: CPU utilization, memory usage, disk space, network bandwidth. <break time='1s'/> Capacity planning predicts future needs. Historical trends show how usage is growing. Business forecasts indicate planned changes. New projects will add workload. <break time='0.5s'/> The goal is to have adequate capacity before it's needed. Running out of capacity causes performance problems or outages. <break time='1s'/> Performance management focuses on meeting expectations. <break time='0.5s'/> Define performance targets in service level agreements. Monitor actual performance against targets. Investigate when performance degrades. Tune systems to improve performance. <break time='0.8s'/> Performance baselines establish normal behavior. You can't identify abnormal performance without knowing what's normal. Establish baselines, then monitor for deviations. <break time='1s'/> Audit focus areas: Are capacity planning processes defined? Is performance monitored against targets? When capacity issues occur, are they addressed proactively? Are there documented capacity forecasts? <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: No capacity planning process. Reactive rather than proactive management. No defined performance targets."
