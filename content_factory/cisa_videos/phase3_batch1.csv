CISA-D1-AD-01,Risk Assessment Methodologies,Marcus_20231218,en-US-DavisNeural,14,concept,"Auditors don't have unlimited time and resources. Risk assessment helps us focus on what matters most. Let's examine the methodologies. <break time='1s'/> Risk assessment fundamentally involves identifying threats, assessing vulnerabilities, evaluating potential impact, and determining likelihood. <break time='0.8s'/> Qualitative risk assessment describes risk in terms like high, medium, and low. It relies on expert judgment rather than precise calculations. <break time='0.5s'/> You gather stakeholders, discuss threats, and agree on ratings. It's faster and doesn't require precise data. But it's subjective. Two people might rate the same risk differently. <break time='0.8s'/> Quantitative risk assessment assigns numerical values. It calculates risk in dollar terms. <break time='0.5s'/> Key formulas: Single Loss Expectancy, or SLE, equals asset value times exposure factor. If a server worth $100,000 is fifty percent damaged, SLE is $50,000. <break time='0.5s'/> Annual Loss Expectancy, or ALE, equals SLE times annualized rate of occurrence. If that loss happens on average once every five years, that's 0.2 annually. ALE equals $50,000 times 0.2, which is $10,000 per year. <break time='0.5s'/> Quantitative is objective and enables cost-benefit analysis. But it requires data that may not exist. How often will a new threat occur? What's the precise impact? <break time='1s'/> Most organizations use a hybrid approach. Qualitative for initial screening, quantitative for significant risks where data exists. <break time='1s'/> For audit planning, risk assessment determines where to focus. High-risk areas get more attention: more testing, more detailed procedures. Low-risk areas get less attention or might be excluded. <break time='0.5s'/> The audit risk model, which we covered earlier, builds on this. Inherent risk captures the natural risk level. Control risk captures how well controls mitigate that risk. Together they determine required audit effort. <break time='0.5s'/> Document your risk assessment. Your conclusions should be supportable. Another qualified auditor should reach similar conclusions given the same information."
CISA-D1-AD-02,Ethics and Professional Standards,Marcus_20231218,en-US-DavisNeural,12,concept,"IS auditors wield significant power. We access sensitive information. Our reports influence decisions. Professional ethics ensure we use that power responsibly. <break time='1s'/> ISACA's Code of Professional Ethics establishes foundational principles. <break time='0.8s'/> Support the implementation of appropriate standards and procedures for information systems. <break time='0.8s'/> Serve in the interest of stakeholders in a lawful manner while maintaining high standards of conduct. <break time='0.8s'/> Maintain privacy and confidentiality of information obtained during duties. <break time='0.8s'/> Maintain competency in respective fields and undertake only those activities for which you're qualified. <break time='0.8s'/> Inform appropriate parties of audit results. <break time='0.8s'/> Support professional education of stakeholders to enhance their understanding of information security and control. <break time='1s'/> Independence is crucial. Auditors must be free from conflicts of interest that might compromise judgment. You shouldn't audit systems you designed, departments where you have personal relationships, or areas where you have financial interests. <break time='0.5s'/> Even the appearance of conflict matters. If others could reasonably question your objectivity, there's a problem, even if you personally remain objective. <break time='1s'/> Confidentiality extends beyond the engagement. Information obtained during an audit cannot be used for personal benefit or disclosed inappropriately. This continues after the engagement ends and even after leaving the organization. <break time='1s'/> Professional skepticism means maintaining questioning mind. Don't accept representations without corroboration. Verify claims. Consider what might be wrong. <break time='0.5s'/> But professional skepticism doesn't mean distrust. It means healthy verification. Trust, but verify."
CISA-D2-AD-01,Strategic Planning for IT,Sarah_sitting_20240617,en-US-AriaNeural,12,concept,"IT strategy should drive IT decisions, and IT strategy should align with business strategy. Let's understand how strategic planning works. <break time='1s'/> Strategic planning operates at three levels. <break time='0.8s'/> Business strategy defines what the organization wants to achieve. Where will we compete? How will we win? What are our long-term objectives? <break time='0.8s'/> IT strategy defines how technology supports business strategy. What capabilities do we need? What platforms will we use? How will IT be organized? <break time='0.8s'/> Operational plans define tactical execution. What projects will we undertake? What resources do we need this year? What are our quarterly milestones? <break time='1s'/> Alignment means IT strategy derives from business strategy. If the business wants to expand globally, IT plans for global infrastructure. If the business wants to improve customer experience, IT invests in customer-facing technology. <break time='0.5s'/> Misalignment occurs when IT pursues technology for technology's sake or when business makes decisions without considering IT implications. <break time='1s'/> Key IT planning documents include: <break time='0.5s'/> IT strategic plan documenting three to five year direction, aligned with business strategy. <break time='0.5s'/> IT tactical plan covering one to three year initiatives, projects, and resource requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> IT operations plan covering current year budgets, staffing, and deliverables. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Obtain the IT strategic plan. Compare it to business strategy. Does IT address business needs? Do IT investments make sense given business direction? Review strategic planning processes. Does IT leadership participate in business planning? Does business leadership approve IT strategy? <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: No formal IT strategy exists. IT strategy doesn't reference business strategy. Plans are outdated."
CISA-D2-AD-02,IT Investment and Portfolio Management,Sarah_sitting_20240617,en-US-AriaNeural,12,concept,"IT investments should create value. Portfolio management ensures the organization invests wisely across all IT initiatives. <break time='1s'/> Think of IT investments like a financial portfolio. You wouldn't put all your retirement savings into one risky stock. You diversify across risk levels and time horizons. <break time='0.5s'/> IT portfolios include: Projects under development. Applications in production. Infrastructure platforms. Services from vendors. Each has different characteristics and investment needs. <break time='1s'/> Investment evaluation should consider: <break time='0.5s'/> Strategic alignment: Does this support business objectives? <break time='0.5s'/> Value proposition: What benefits will it deliver? Can we quantify them? <break time='0.5s'/> Risk: What could go wrong? How likely? How severe? <break time='0.5s'/> Resource requirements: What will it cost in money, people, and time? <break time='0.5s'/> Dependencies: What does it depend on? What depends on it? <break time='1s'/> Common evaluation methods include: <break time='0.5s'/> Return on investment, or ROI: Net benefit divided by cost. Expressed as a percentage. <break time='0.5s'/> Net present value, or NPV: Future cash flows discounted to present value. Positive NPV means the investment creates value. <break time='0.5s'/> Internal rate of return, or IRR: The discount rate at which NPV equals zero. Compare to the organization's cost of capital. <break time='0.5s'/> Payback period: How long until the investment pays for itself. <break time='1s'/> Portfolio management balances the entire portfolio. Don't just evaluate individual projects. Consider: Are we overinvested in any one area? Is our risk profile appropriate? Do we have the right mix of quick wins and long-term investments? <break time='0.5s'/> Audit focus: Are investments evaluated consistently? Does the methodology include non-financial factors? Is the portfolio actively managed or just a collection of approved projects?"
CISA-D3-AD-01,Project Management Best Practices,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,14,concept,"Projects fail when management fails. Understanding project management helps auditors identify risks and control weaknesses. <break time='1s'/> Project management encompasses initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing projects. Each phase has key activities. <break time='0.8s'/> Initiation establishes the project. The project charter formally authorizes the project, names the project manager, and establishes initial scope and constraints. Without proper initiation, projects lack clear authority and boundaries. <break time='0.8s'/> Planning defines how work will be accomplished. The project plan includes scope statement, work breakdown structure, schedule, budget, resource plan, risk plan, quality plan, and communication plan. Inadequate planning is a primary cause of project failure. <break time='0.8s'/> Execution does the work. The project manager directs the team, manages stakeholders, and ensures work follows the plan. Most project effort occurs here. <break time='0.8s'/> Monitoring and control tracks progress and makes corrections. Compare actual to planned. Identify variances. Take corrective action. Report status to stakeholders. <break time='0.8s'/> Closing formalizes completion. Obtain formal acceptance. Transfer deliverables. Document lessons learned. Release resources. <break time='1s'/> Common project risks that auditors should watch for: <break time='0.5s'/> Scope creep: Requirements keep expanding without adjusting schedule and budget. <break time='0.5s'/> Unrealistic schedules: Deadlines set without regard to work required. <break time='0.5s'/> Resource constraints: Key people unavailable or overallocated. <break time='0.5s'/> Poor communication: Stakeholders don't know what's happening. <break time='0.5s'/> Inadequate testing: Quality sacrificed to meet deadlines. <break time='1s'/> Audit approach: Review project documentation. Interview key stakeholders. Assess whether controls are adequate given project risk. Look for warning signs like chronically missed milestones, frequent scope changes, or team turnover."
CISA-D3-AD-02,Software Acquisition and Vendor Management,Wayne_20240711_1,en-US-GuyNeural,12,concept,"Not all software is built in-house. Understanding the acquisition process and vendor management helps auditors assess risks in purchased solutions. <break time='1s'/> The acquisition process typically follows stages. <break time='0.8s'/> Requirements definition: What do we need? Before looking at products, document the detailed requirements. Functional requirements describe what it must do. Non-functional requirements describe performance, security, scalability. <break time='0.8s'/> Market research: What's available? Understand the vendor landscape. Identify potential products. Sometimes there's no suitable product, and you build custom. <break time='0.8s'/> Request for proposal, or RFP: Formally solicit vendor responses. The RFP describes requirements, evaluation criteria, timeline, and contractual requirements. Vendors respond with proposals describing their solution, pricing, and qualifications. <break time='0.8s'/> Evaluation: Score proposals against defined criteria. Criteria might include functionality, cost, vendor stability, implementation support, references. Conduct demonstrations and reference checks. <break time='0.8s'/> Contract negotiation: Define terms of the agreement. Include service levels, support obligations, pricing, intellectual property rights, and termination provisions. <break time='0.8s'/> Implementation: Configure, integrate, test, and deploy the solution. <break time='1s'/> Vendor management extends beyond acquisition. Ongoing oversight includes: <break time='0.5s'/> Performance monitoring: Is the vendor meeting service levels? <break time='0.5s'/> Relationship management: Regular communication and issue resolution. <break time='0.5s'/> Risk management: Monitoring vendor financial health, security practices, and compliance. <break time='0.5s'/> Contract management: Tracking obligations, renewals, and changes. <break time='1s'/> Audit focus: Was a documented evaluation process followed? Do contracts protect organizational interests? Is vendor performance monitored? Are risks appropriately managed?"
CISA-D4-AD-01,Business Impact Analysis,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,12,concept,"Business Impact Analysis, or BIA, identifies critical business functions and the impact if they're disrupted. It's foundational to business continuity planning. <break time='1s'/> The BIA answers several key questions: <break time='0.5s'/> What business functions are critical? <break time='0.5s'/> What resources do they depend on, including systems, people, facilities, and vendors? <break time='0.5s'/> What's the impact if they're unavailable, measured in financial, operational, regulatory, and reputational terms? <break time='0.5s'/> How quickly must they be recovered? <break time='1s'/> The BIA process involves several steps. <break time='0.8s'/> Identify business functions and processes. What does the organization actually do? <break time='0.8s'/> Identify dependencies. What systems, data, people, and facilities does each function need? <break time='0.8s'/> Determine impact over time. Impact often increases with duration. Four hours down might be inconvenient. Four days down might be catastrophic. <break time='0.8s'/> Establish recovery priorities and objectives. <break time='1s'/> Key metrics coming from the BIA: <break time='0.5s'/> Recovery Time Objective, or RTO: How quickly must the function be restored? If RTO is four hours, you need recovery capabilities that can achieve four hours. <break time='0.5s'/> Recovery Point Objective, or RPO: How much data loss is acceptable? If RPO is one hour, you need backups at least every hour. <break time='0.5s'/> Maximum Tolerable Downtime, or MTD: The absolute maximum the organization can survive without the function. RTO must be less than MTD. <break time='1s'/> Audit considerations: Is a BIA documented? Is it current? Did business owners participate? Do recovery capabilities match BIA requirements? If RTO is four hours but actual recovery capability is twelve hours, there's a gap. <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: BIA doesn't exist or is outdated. Recovery objectives aren't defined. Recovery capabilities don't match stated objectives."
CISA-D4-AD-02,Business Continuity Planning Process,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,14,concept,"Business Continuity Planning ensures the organization can continue critical operations during and after a disaster. It builds on the Business Impact Analysis. <break time='1s'/> The BCP lifecycle has several phases. <break time='0.8s'/> Initiation: Establish the BCP program. Obtain management commitment. Define scope and objectives. Assign responsibilities. <break time='0.8s'/> Business Impact Analysis: We covered this in the previous video. Identify critical functions and recovery requirements. <break time='0.8s'/> Strategy development: Determine how you'll achieve recovery objectives. Options include alternate sites, redundant systems, workarounds, and agreements with third parties. Select strategies that meet RTO and RPO at acceptable cost. <break time='0.8s'/> Plan development: Document detailed procedures. Who does what? In what sequence? What resources are needed? Plans should be actionable during a high-stress situation. <break time='0.8s'/> Testing: Verify plans actually work. Testing ranges from tabletop exercises to full-scale drills. Start simple and progress to more complex tests. <break time='0.8s'/> Maintenance: Keep plans current. Review after organizational changes. Update contact information. Incorporate lessons from tests and actual events. <break time='1s'/> Recovery site options range by capability and cost: <break time='0.5s'/> Hot site: Fully equipped and ready. Data replicated continuously. Can be operational in hours. Most expensive. <break time='0.5s'/> Warm site: Partially equipped. Needs some setup. Operational in days. Moderate cost. <break time='0.5s'/> Cold site: Empty facility with basic infrastructure. Needs everything installed. Operational in weeks. Least expensive. <break time='0.5s'/> The choice depends on RTO. If you need recovery in four hours, you need a hot site. <break time='1s'/> Testing types: <break time='0.5s'/> Checklist review: Participants review plans for completeness. <break time='0.5s'/> Tabletop exercise: Walk through a scenario verbally. <break time='0.5s'/> Simulation: Simulate a disaster without activating recovery. <break time='0.5s'/> Parallel test: Process at the recovery site while primary remains operational. <break time='0.5s'/> Full interruption: Actually switch operations to the recovery site. Highest risk, highest assurance. <break time='0.5s'/> Test annually at minimum. Document results. Fix identified gaps."
