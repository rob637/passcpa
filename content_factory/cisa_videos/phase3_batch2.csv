CISA-D4-AD-03,Disaster Recovery Site Options,josh_lite3_20230714,en-US-ChristopherNeural,10,concept,"Choosing the right disaster recovery site involves balancing recovery speed against cost. Let's examine the options in detail. <break time='1s'/> Cold site provides basic facilities: power, cooling, network connectivity, and physical space. There's no equipment installed. After a disaster, you procure hardware, install systems, restore data, and configure applications. <break time='0.5s'/> RTO for cold sites is typically weeks. Cost is lowest because you're only paying for empty space. Use cold sites for non-critical systems or as a backup to other strategies. <break time='1s'/> Warm site has some infrastructure in place: servers, network equipment, maybe older hardware or reduced capacity. Software may be installed but not current. Data backups are available but not immediately ready. <break time='0.5s'/> RTO for warm sites is typically days. Cost is moderate. Warm sites balance cost and recovery speed for systems that aren't immediately critical but need reasonably quick recovery. <break time='1s'/> Hot site mirrors the production environment. Same hardware, same software, current configurations. Data is replicated continuously or very frequently. You can switch operations quickly. <break time='0.5s'/> RTO for hot sites can be hours or even minutes. Cost is highest because you're essentially running two data centers. Use hot sites for critical systems where downtime has severe impact. <break time='1s'/> Mobile sites are containerized data centers that can be transported to any location. They provide flexibility for organizations with multiple facilities or unique requirements. <break time='0.8s'/> Cloud-based recovery has changed the economics. You can maintain a standby environment in the cloud at lower cost than a physical hot site, then scale up during a disaster. <break time='0.5s'/> Key consideration: The site choice must match the RTO from your Business Impact Analysis. There's no point paying for a hot site if your RTO is two weeks. There's no point having a cold site if your RTO is four hours."
CISA-D5-AD-01,Emerging Technology Risk Assessment,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,14,concept,"Emerging technologies create new risks that auditors must understand. Let's examine key areas: cloud computing, mobile, IoT, and artificial intelligence. <break time='1s'/> Cloud computing shifts processing and data to third-party infrastructure. Risks include: <break time='0.5s'/> Data sovereignty: Where does your data physically reside? Does it cross borders? Different jurisdictions have different requirements. <break time='0.5s'/> Vendor dependence: What happens if the vendor fails or changes terms? Can you move to another provider? <break time='0.5s'/> Shared responsibility: Security is shared between you and the provider. Understand the boundaries. The provider secures the infrastructure. You secure your data and access. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit implications: You may not be able to audit the provider directly. Rely on third-party attestations like SOC reports. <break time='1s'/> Mobile devices introduce risks: <break time='0.5s'/> Data leakage: Corporate data on personal devices. What happens when an employee leaves? <break time='0.5s'/> Device diversity: Supporting multiple operating systems and versions. <break time='0.5s'/> Connection security: Devices connect from untrusted networks. <break time='0.5s'/> Controls include mobile device management, containerization to separate corporate and personal data, and remote wipe capability. <break time='1s'/> Internet of Things expands the attack surface dramatically. Devices may have weak security, no update mechanisms, and long lifespans. A compromised device can be a network entry point. <break time='0.5s'/> Controls include network segmentation, security requirements in procurement, and monitoring for anomalous behavior. <break time='1s'/> Artificial intelligence introduces unique risks: <break time='0.5s'/> Model bias: AI can perpetuate or amplify biases in training data. <break time='0.5s'/> Explainability: Can you explain why the AI made a decision? <break time='0.5s'/> Data dependency: AI needs massive data, raising privacy concerns. <break time='0.5s'/> Adversarial attacks: Inputs designed to fool the AI. <break time='0.5s'/> Audit focus: Understand how the technology is used, assess specific risks, and verify controls address those risks."
CISA-D5-AD-02,Security Awareness and Training,Daisy-iทvestment_V2,en-US-JennyNeural,10,concept,"People are often the weakest link and the strongest asset in security. Security awareness programs aim to make people an asset. <break time='1s'/> Security awareness creates a security-conscious culture. Everyone understands they have a role in protecting information. They recognize threats and know how to respond. <break time='0.8s'/> Awareness programs typically include: <break time='0.5s'/> New employee orientation covering security policies, acceptable use, and reporting procedures. <break time='0.5s'/> Annual refresher training reinforcing key concepts and updating on new threats. <break time='0.5s'/> Role-based training for positions with specific security responsibilities. <break time='0.5s'/> Targeted campaigns addressing current threats like phishing or ransomware. <break time='0.5s'/> Ongoing communication through newsletters, posters, and reminders. <break time='1s'/> Effective training goes beyond policy recitation. <break time='0.5s'/> Make it relevant: Show how threats apply to their actual jobs. <break time='0.5s'/> Make it practical: Teach specific behaviors, not abstract concepts. <break time='0.5s'/> Make it interactive: Simulations and exercises, not just presentations. <break time='0.5s'/> Make it measurable: Track completion and test comprehension. <break time='1s'/> Phishing simulations are particularly valuable. Send fake phishing emails and track who clicks. Those who click get additional training. The organization tracks improvement over time. <break time='0.8s'/> Audit approach: Review the awareness program. Is training mandatory? Is it current? Is completion tracked? Are results measured? Interview employees to assess actual awareness. Test whether they know what policies require. <break time='0.5s'/> Common findings: Training is outdated. Completion isn't tracked. No measurement of effectiveness."
CISA-EX-03,Exam Strategy Time Management,Tyler_20230918_1,en-US-EricNeural,10,exam_strategy,"You have four hours for one hundred fifty questions. That's ninety-six seconds per question. Let's develop a time management strategy. <break time='1s'/> First principle: Don't spend too much time on any single question. If you don't know the answer after reading it twice and eliminating options, mark it for review and move on. <break time='0.5s'/> You can always come back. An unanswered difficult question is the same as a wrong answer, but it cost you time that could have earned points on easier questions. <break time='1s'/> Recommended approach: <break time='0.5s'/> First pass: Answer questions you know confidently. Skip questions that require significant thought. Your goal is to bank easy points quickly. <break time='0.5s'/> Second pass: Return to skipped questions. Apply elimination strategies. Make educated guesses if needed. <break time='0.5s'/> Final review: Check flagged questions one more time. Verify you haven't missed any questions. <break time='1s'/> Time checkpoints help ensure you stay on pace. <break time='0.5s'/> After 50 questions: You should have used about 80 minutes. If you've used less, you're doing well. If you've used more, speed up. <break time='0.5s'/> After 100 questions: You should have used about 160 minutes. You have roughly an hour remaining for the last 50 questions and your final review. <break time='1s'/> On specific question types: <break time='0.5s'/> Straightforward knowledge questions should take 30 to 60 seconds. <break time='0.5s'/> Scenario questions with long stems take longer to read but the actual question is often straightforward. Read the question first to know what you're looking for. <break time='0.5s'/> Best answer questions where multiple options seem correct require more thought. Identify what makes one option better. <break time='0.5s'/> Don't change answers unless you have a clear reason. Your first instinct is usually correct."
CISA-EX-04,How to Interpret CISA Scenarios,Tyler_20230918_1,en-US-EricNeural,12,exam_strategy,"Scenario-based questions test application, not just recall. Let's develop a framework for approaching them. <break time='1s'/> Scenario questions follow a pattern: <break time='0.5s'/> The stem provides background information about an organization, situation, or event. <break time='0.5s'/> The question asks what you would do, what went wrong, what's the priority, or what's the best conclusion. <break time='0.5s'/> The options include distractors that sound plausible. <break time='1s'/> Step one: Read the question first. Before reading the scenario, look at what's being asked. This tells you what to look for in the scenario. <break time='0.5s'/> If the question asks about the most critical control weakness, you're looking for control problems. <break time='0.5s'/> If the question asks for the best next step, you're looking for context about current status. <break time='1s'/> Step two: Read the scenario with the question in mind. Identify relevant facts. Ignore distracting details that don't relate to the question. <break time='0.5s'/> Look for keywords that signal issues: 'always', 'never', 'no documentation', 'was not', 'bypassed'. <break time='0.8s'/> Step three: Eliminate wrong answers. <break time='0.5s'/> Eliminate options that contradict facts in the scenario. <break time='0.5s'/> Eliminate options that are technically correct but don't address the specific question. <break time='0.5s'/> Eliminate options that are too extreme or too narrow. <break time='1s'/> Step four: Choose the best remaining answer. <break time='0.5s'/> When multiple options seem correct, look for the one that most directly addresses the question as asked. <break time='0.5s'/> Consider what an IS auditor would actually do. We assess, we recommend, we report. We don't implement, we don't operate, we don't decide. <break time='1s'/> Common traps: <break time='0.5s'/> Options that are true but don't answer the question. <break time='0.5s'/> Options that assume facts not in the scenario. <break time='0.5s'/> Options that skip steps in a logical sequence."
CISA-EX-05,Final Review Practice Scenarios,Tyler_20230918_1,en-US-EricNeural,15,exam_strategy,"Let's walk through sample scenarios applying our framework. These will build your pattern recognition. <break time='1s'/> Scenario one: An organization experiences a data breach. During investigation, the IS auditor discovers that logs were overwritten and cannot be recovered. What should the auditor identify as the primary control weakness? <break time='0.5s'/> Think about it. Logs were overwritten, so we cannot investigate the breach fully. What's the control weakness? <break time='0.5s'/> Possible answers might include: inadequate log retention, lack of intrusion detection, insufficient access controls, missing data encryption. <break time='0.5s'/> The scenario specifically mentions logs were overwritten. The question asks about the primary control weakness given the facts presented. The answer is inadequate log retention. The other options might be true, but they're not supported by the scenario. <break time='1s'/> Scenario two: During a change management audit, you find that emergency changes bypass the normal approval process but are documented afterward. What should you conclude? <break time='0.5s'/> Emergency changes with retroactive documentation is actually an acceptable practice in most change management frameworks. The key is that changes are still documented and reviewed. <break time='0.5s'/> If an option says this is a significant control weakness, it's probably wrong. If an option says this is acceptable if documented and reviewed within a defined timeframe, that's likely correct. <break time='1s'/> Scenario three: Management asks the IS auditor to help implement a new control to address a finding from the previous audit. What should the auditor do? <break time='0.5s'/> This tests independence. Auditors should not implement controls because they would then audit their own work. <break time='0.5s'/> The answer would be to decline and explain that implementation would compromise independence, but offer to provide guidance on control objectives. <break time='1s'/> Pattern recognition: As you study, you'll notice the same themes recurring. Independence. Risk-based approach. Prioritization. Documentation. Control categories. Recognizing the theme helps you identify the right answer."
CISA-D1-SC-02,Scenario: Planning an IT Audit Function,Marcus_20231218,en-US-DavisNeural,14,scenario,"You've been hired as the new IT Audit Director for a mid-sized financial services company. The previous director retired, and the IT audit function has been inactive for eighteen months. The board wants a capable IT audit function within six months. Where do you start? <break time='1s'/> You begin with discovery. <break time='0.5s'/> You meet with key stakeholders: the Chief Audit Executive, the CIO, the CISO, business unit leaders, and the audit committee chair. You want to understand their concerns, their priorities, and their expectations. <break time='0.5s'/> You review existing documentation: previous audit reports, organizational charts, IT strategic plans, risk assessments, regulatory examination findings. <break time='0.5s'/> You assess the current state of IT. What systems exist? What changes are planned? What incidents have occurred? <break time='1s'/> Next, you develop a risk assessment. <break time='0.5s'/> You identify the IT universe: all systems, applications, processes, and projects that could be audited. <break time='0.5s'/> You assess risk for each area considering inherent risk factors and control environment. Regulatory sensitive areas get higher risk ratings. Systems with recent incidents get higher ratings. Areas never audited or not audited recently get higher ratings. <break time='0.5s'/> You prioritize based on risk. Limited resources mean you can't audit everything. Focus on the highest risks first. <break time='1s'/> You develop the audit plan. <break time='0.5s'/> Based on resources and risk assessment, you determine which audits to conduct in the next year. You consider regulatory requirements, management concerns, and elapsed time since last audit. <break time='0.5s'/> You present the plan to the audit committee for approval. <break time='1s'/> You establish infrastructure. <breaktml='0.5s'/> You create standard methodologies: risk assessment approach, work paper standards, reporting templates. <break time='0.5s'/> You determine staffing needs and begin recruiting or developing the team. <break time='0.5s'/> You establish relationships with co-source partners if internal resources aren't sufficient. <break time='1s'/> You begin executing audits. <break time='0.5s'/> Start with one or two audits to work out the process. Apply lessons learned to subsequent audits. Build credibility through professional, value-added work. <break time='0.5s'/> Within six months, you have a functioning IT audit group with a risk-based plan, executing quality audits."
