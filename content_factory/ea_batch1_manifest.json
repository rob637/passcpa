    "script_full": "Welcome back. Today we are tackling the number one reason students fail Part 2 of the EA exam: S-Corp Basis. Specifically, the 'Debt Trap'. <break time='1.0s' /> Here is the scenario: Your client, Bob, guarantees a $100,000 bank loan for his struggling S-Corp. He thinks he can now deduct $100,000 of losses. The IRS says: 'Absolutely not.' Bob has zero basis. Bob is angry. <break time='1.0s' /> Unlike partnerships, S-Corporations have two distinct buckets of basis: Stock Basis and Debt Basis. Stock Basis is what you paid for the stock, plus income, minus distributions. Think of this as your 'Equity'. Debt Basis is created only when you, the shareholder, loan actual money directly to the corporation. This is the 'Economic Outlay' doctrine. If cash didn't leave your personal bank account and land in the company account, you do not have basis. A guarantee is just a promise, not an outlay. <break time='1.0s' /> Now, let's talk about the 'Ordering Rules'. The IRS forces us to adjust basis in a specific order every year. Memorize this acronym: I.D.L. First, Income items. Second, Distributions. Third, Losses. If you mess up this order, you will calculate the wrong taxability for the distribution and the wrong allowable loss.",

Welcome to Partnership taxation, where liabilities are your friend. <break time='1.0s' /> Today we define the 'Two Worlds': Inside Basis and Outside Basis. In a partnership, every partner is personally liable or economically at risk. Therefore, when the partnership takes out a $1,000,000 loan, the partners get to increase their 'Outside Basis' by their share of that loan. This is huge. It means you can deduct losses greater than your cash investment, funded entirely by bank debt. <break time='1.0s' /> We use the 'BASE' mnemonic for the running tally: Beginning Basis, Add Contributions and Income and Increase in Liabilities. Subtract Distributions, Losses, and Decrease in Liabilities. Equals Ending Basis. Pay close attention to that liability line. If the partnership pays off debt, your basis goes DOWN.",
