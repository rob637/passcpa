# SCENE 1 — TITLE
**Duration:** 15 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
If there's one topic that trips up EA candidates, it's shareholder basis in S corporations. But here's the good news. Once you understand the rules, it's actually a formula you can master. Today, we're going to demystify S Corp basis, step by step.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
S CORPORATION SHAREHOLDER BASIS
The Key to Unlocking Loss Deductions
EA Part 2 | IRC §1367
```

---

# SCENE 2 — WHY IT MATTERS
**Duration:** 25 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Why should you care about basis? Because without sufficient basis, your client cannot deduct their share of S corporation losses. A shareholder with fifty thousand dollars in allocated losses but only ten thousand dollars in basis? They can only deduct ten thousand. The rest gets suspended. Potentially forever. Basis also determines whether distributions are tax-free or taxable.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
WHY BASIS MATTERS

✓ Determines tax-free distributions
✓ Limits deductible losses  
✓ Affects gain on stock sale
✓ Impacts debt repayment

NO BASIS = NO DEDUCTION
```

---

# SCENE 3 — TWO TYPES
**Duration:** 35 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Shareholders have two types of basis. First, stock basis. This is what the shareholder paid for their stock, plus any additional capital contributions. Second, debt basis. And this is critical. Debt basis only comes from direct loans the shareholder personally makes to the S corporation. If the shareholder guarantees a bank loan, does that create debt basis? No. The loan must be directly from the shareholder to the corporation. Guarantees don't count. Total basis equals stock basis plus debt basis.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
TWO TYPES OF BASIS

STOCK BASIS          |  DEBT BASIS
---------------------|--------------------
• Initial investment |  • Direct loans FROM
• Additional capital |    shareholder TO
• Gifts/inheritance  |    corporation
                     |
                     |  NOT: Bank loan
                     |  guarantees!

TOTAL = Stock Basis + Debt Basis
```

---

# SCENE 4 — INITIAL BASIS
**Duration:** 30 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Initial stock basis depends on how the shareholder acquired their stock. Purchased for cash? Basis equals what they paid. Contributed property? They take the property's adjusted basis, not fair market value. Received as a gift? Carryover the donor's basis. Inherited? Step up to fair market value at date of death. Example: Sam purchases one hundred shares for fifty thousand dollars cash. Sam's initial stock basis is fifty thousand dollars.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
INITIAL STOCK BASIS

Purchase      → Amount paid
Property      → Adjusted basis
Gift          → Donor's basis
Inheritance   → FMV at death

EXAMPLE:
Sam buys shares for $50,000
Initial Basis = $50,000
```

---

# SCENE 5 — INCREASES
**Duration:** 35 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Now, what increases basis? Stock basis goes up for capital contributions, ordinary business income, separately stated income items, and here's one people miss: tax-exempt income also increases basis. Why? Because even though it's not taxable, it represents real economic benefit. For debt basis, the only increase is making additional direct loans. In our example, Sam's fifty thousand beginning basis, plus fifteen thousand income, plus two thousand tax-exempt income, equals sixty-seven thousand before decreases.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
BASIS INCREASES ↑

+ Capital contributions
+ Ordinary income
+ Separately stated income
+ Tax-exempt income

EXAMPLE:
$50,000 beginning
+15,000 income
+ 2,000 tax-exempt
───────
$67,000 before decreases
```

---

# SCENE 6 — DECREASES (KEY!)
**Duration:** 45 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Here's where it gets tricky, and where the exam loves to test you. Basis decreases follow a strict order. Step one: distributions reduce basis first, but never below zero. Step two: nondeductible, noncapital expenses, like fifty percent disallowed meals and penalties. Step three: deductible losses and deductions. Notice this is after distributions! Step four: the depletion deduction. Why does order matter? If someone takes a big distribution first, there may not be enough basis left to absorb losses. Remember the memory aid: D-N-D-D. Distributions, Nondeductible, Deductions, Depletion.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
DECREASES — ORDER MATTERS!

Step 1: DISTRIBUTIONS (first!)
         ↓
Step 2: NONDEDUCTIBLE expenses
         ↓
Step 3: DEDUCTIONS & losses
         ↓
Step 4: DEPLETION

⚠️ Cannot go below zero!

Memory: D-N-D-D
```

# SCENE 7 — LOSS LIMITS
**Duration:** 35 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
What happens when losses exceed total basis? First, losses reduce stock basis. If stock basis hits zero, then and only then, losses can reduce debt basis. If the shareholder still has excess losses after both bases hit zero, those losses are suspended. They don't disappear. They carry forward indefinitely until the shareholder gets more basis. Example: thirty thousand in losses but only twenty thousand total basis means they deduct twenty thousand this year and carry forward ten thousand.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
WHEN LOSSES > BASIS

1. Reduce stock basis first
2. Then reduce debt basis
3. Excess = SUSPENDED
   (carries forward)

EXAMPLE:
$30,000 loss
-20,000 basis limit
───────
$10,000 suspended
```

---

# SCENE 8 — DEBT RESTORATION
**Duration:** 30 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Here's a nuance the exam tests: the debt basis restoration rule. If losses reduce debt basis below its original amount, future income must first restore debt basis before stock basis can increase. Say a shareholder loaned ten thousand to the corporation. Year one losses reduced debt basis to zero. Year two, they get twenty-five thousand of income. The first ten thousand restores debt basis. Only the remaining fifteen thousand increases stock basis. This catches many candidates off guard.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
DEBT RESTORATION RULE

Year 1: Losses reduce debt basis → $0

Year 2: Income of $25,000
        First $10K → restore debt basis
        Then $15K → increase stock basis

⚠️ Restoration is MANDATORY
```

# SCENE 9 — EXAMPLE SETUP
**Duration:** 25 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Let's work through a comprehensive example. Sarah invests one hundred thousand dollars for S corp stock and makes a direct loan of twenty thousand. Her total beginning basis is one hundred twenty thousand. Her year-end K-1 shows: thirty-five thousand ordinary income, three thousand tax-exempt interest, fifty thousand cash distribution, five thousand nondeductible expenses, and eight thousand charitable contributions. What's her ending basis?
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
EXAMPLE: SARAH

Beginning:
Stock Basis: $100,000
Debt Basis:   $20,000
Total:       $120,000

K-1 Items:
• Income:        $35,000
• Tax-exempt:     $3,000
• Distribution:  $50,000
• Nondeductible:  $5,000
• Charitable:     $8,000
```

---

# SCENE 10 — EXAMPLE SOLUTION
**Duration:** 45 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Here's the solution. Start with stock basis of one hundred thousand. First, apply all increases: thirty-five thousand income plus three thousand tax-exempt equals one hundred thirty-eight thousand. Now decreases in order. Step one: distribution of fifty thousand brings us to eighty-eight thousand. Step two: nondeductible expenses of five thousand brings us to eighty-three thousand. Step three: charitable contribution of eight thousand brings us to seventy-five thousand. Ending stock basis: seventy-five thousand. Debt basis unchanged at twenty thousand. Total ending basis: ninety-five thousand.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
SOLUTION

Stock Basis:           $100,000
+ Income:              + 35,000
+ Tax-exempt:          +  3,000
                      ─────────
After increases:       $138,000

- Distribution:        - 50,000 → $88,000
- Nondeductible:       -  5,000 → $83,000
- Charitable:          -  8,000 → $75,000

ENDING STOCK BASIS:     $75,000
DEBT BASIS:             $20,000
TOTAL:                  $95,000
```

# SCENE 11 — AAA
**Duration:** 30 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
For S corporations with accumulated earnings and profits from prior C corp years, distributions get more complex. The Accumulated Adjustments Account, or triple-A, tracks earnings since the S election. Distributions come first from triple-A, tax-free to the extent of basis. If triple-A is exhausted, distributions come from E and P as dividends. After that, return of basis, then capital gain. If the S corp was never a C corp, there's no E and P, much simpler.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
AAA vs E&P

Distribution ordering:
1. From AAA (tax-free)
2. From E&P (dividend)
3. Return of basis
4. Capital gain

Never a C corp? Skip step 2!
```

---

# SCENE 12 — EXAM TRAPS
**Duration:** 35 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Five traps examiners love. Trap one: Loan guarantees do not create debt basis. Only direct loans count. Trap two: Distributions reduce basis before losses. This limits deductions. Trap three: Tax-exempt income does increase basis. Don't forget it. Trap four: Income restores debt basis before increasing stock basis. Trap five: Neither basis can go below zero. Excess amounts are suspended or taxable, not negative.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
EXAM TRAPS ⚠️

1. Loan guarantees ≠ debt basis
2. Distributions BEFORE losses
3. Tax-exempt DOES increase basis
4. Restore debt basis FIRST
5. Basis cannot go negative
```

Find:
1. Deductible loss?
2. Suspended loss?
3. Ending basis?

⏸️ PAUSE TO SOLVE
```

---

# SCENE 15 — SOLUTION
**Duration:** 35 seconds

### PASTE INTO VYOND TTS:
```
Solution. Start with forty thousand stock basis plus two thousand tax-exempt equals forty-two thousand. Decreases in order: distribution minus ten thousand leaves thirty-two thousand. Nondeductible minus three thousand leaves twenty-nine thousand. Now losses: twenty-nine thousand stock plus fifteen thousand debt equals forty-four thousand available. Jake deducts forty-four thousand. Suspended: sixty-five thousand minus forty-four thousand equals twenty-one thousand. Ending basis: zero for both stock and debt.
```

### ON SCREEN TEXT:
```
SOLUTION

$40,000 + $2,000 = $42,000
- Distribution:    -$10,000 → $32,000
- Nondeductible:   - $3,000 → $29,000

Loss limit: $29,000 + $15,000 = $44,000

1. Deductible: $44,000 ✓
2. Suspended: $21,000 ✓
3. Ending: $0 stock, $0 debt ✓
```
