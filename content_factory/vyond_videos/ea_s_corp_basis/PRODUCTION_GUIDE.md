✓ Affects gain on stock sale
✓ Impacts debt repayment taxation
```

NO BASIS = NO DEDUCTION
```

```

**On-Screen Text (Left Box - Title):**

DEBT BASIS
```

NOT: Loans FROM third parties!
```

**On-Screen Text (Bottom Formula):**
```

🧠 "Direct Debt Delivers Basis"
Only direct shareholder-to-corporation loans count!
```

### SCENE 4: Initial Basis
**Duration:** 30 seconds  
**Background:** Office with desk  
**Props:** Document/contract icon

**On-Screen Text (Header):**
```
INITIAL STOCK BASIS
```

**On-Screen Text (Table - build row by row):**
```
METHOD               →  INITIAL BASIS
─────────────────────────────────────
Purchase for cash    →  Amount paid
Contribute property  →  Adjusted basis
Gift                 →  Donor's basis
Inheritance          →  FMV at death
```

**On-Screen Text (Example Box):**
```

```

### SCENE 5: Basis Increases
**Duration:** 35 seconds  
**Background:** Light green tint (positive/growth)  
**Animation:** Bar chart growing, green arrows

**On-Screen Text (Header):**
```
BASIS INCREASES
```

**On-Screen Text (Stock Section):**
```
STOCK BASIS GOES UP FOR:
↑ Capital contributions
↑ Separately stated income items
↑ Nonseparately computed income
↑ Tax-exempt income
↑ Excess depletion over basis
```

**On-Screen Text (Debt Section):**
```
DEBT BASIS INCREASES:
• Only from additional direct loans
```

**On-Screen Text (Example - animate numbers):**
```
Sam's Beginning Basis:        $50,000
+ Share of ordinary income:   +15,000
+ Share of tax-exempt income:  +2,000
= Basis Before Decreases:     $67,000 ↑

```
BASIS DECREASES - ORDER MATTERS!
```

**On-Screen Text (Steps - animate as waterfall):**
```
STEP 1: Distributions
        (first, but cannot go below zero)
               ↓
STEP 2: Nondeductible, noncapital expenses
        (50% meals, penalties, etc.)
               ↓
STEP 3: Deduction and loss items
        (separately stated + ordinary loss)
               ↓
STEP 4: Depletion deduction
        (for oil & gas properties)
```

**On-Screen Text (Warning Box):**
```
⚠️ STOCK BASIS CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO!
```

**On-Screen Text (Memory Aid):**

```

WHEN LOSSES EXCEED BASIS
```

**On-Screen Text (Key Rule):**
```
TOTAL BASIS = Stock Basis + Debt Basis

Losses deducted FIRST against stock basis,
THEN against debt basis
```

**On-Screen Text (If/Then):**
```
IF LOSSES > TOTAL BASIS:
• Deduct up to total basis
• Excess losses are SUSPENDED
• Suspended losses carry forward
  indefinitely until basis restored
```

**On-Screen Text (Example):**
```
Stock Basis:         $67,000
Debt Basis:          $10,000
Total Basis:         $77,000

Allocated Loss:      $90,000
