## SCENE 1: Title (15 seconds)

If there's one topic that trips up E-A candidates, it's shareholder basis in S corporations. [PAUSE]

But here's the good news. [PAUSE]

Once you understand the rules, it's actually a formula you can master. Today, we're going to demystify S Corp basis, step by step.

---

## SCENE 2: Why Basis Matters (25 seconds)

Why should you care about basis? [PAUSE]

Because without sufficient basis, your client cannot deduct their share of S corporation losses. [PAUSE]

A shareholder with fifty thousand dollars in allocated losses but only ten thousand dollars in basis? [PAUSE] They can only deduct ten thousand. The rest gets suspended. Potentially forever if they don't get more basis.

Basis also determines whether distributions are tax-free or taxable. Get this wrong, and your client has an unexpected tax bill.

---

## SCENE 3: Two Types of Basis (35 seconds)

Shareholders have two types of basis. [PAUSE]

First, STOCK BASIS. This is what the shareholder paid for their stock, plus any additional capital contributions.

Second, DEBT BASIS. And this is critical. [PAUSE]

Debt basis ONLY comes from direct loans the shareholder personally makes to the S corporation. [PAUSE]

If the shareholder personally guarantees a bank loan to the corporation, does that create debt basis? [PAUSE] No!

The loan must be directly from the shareholder to the corporation. Guarantees and indirect loans don't count. [PAUSE]

Total basis for loss deduction purposes equals stock basis plus debt basis.

---

## SCENE 4: Initial Basis (30 seconds)

Let's start at the beginning. Initial stock basis depends on HOW the shareholder acquired their stock. [PAUSE]

Purchased for cash? Basis equals what they paid. [PAUSE]

Contributed property to the corporation? They take the property's adjusted basis. Not fair market value. This is like a Section three-fifty-one transfer. [PAUSE]

Received as a gift? Carryover the donor's basis. [PAUSE]

Inherited? Step-up to fair market value at date of death. [PAUSE]

Let's track an example. Sam purchases one hundred shares of Reynolds S Corp for fifty thousand dollars cash. Sam's initial stock basis is fifty thousand dollars.

---

## SCENE 5: Basis Increases (35 seconds)

Now let's talk about what INCREASES basis. [PAUSE]

Stock basis goes up when the shareholder makes capital contributions. Putting more money into the company. [PAUSE]

It also increases for their allocable share of ALL income items. Both separately stated items like capital gains and interest, and the non-separately computed income, which is ordinary business income. [PAUSE]

Here's one people miss. Tax-exempt income ALSO increases basis. [PAUSE]

Why? Because even though it's not taxable, it represents real economic benefit. [PAUSE]

For debt basis, the only increase is making additional direct loans to the corporation. Simple.

In our example, Sam's beginning basis of fifty thousand, plus fifteen thousand ordinary income, plus two thousand tax-exempt income, equals sixty-seven thousand before decreases.

---

## SCENE 6: Basis Decreases (40 seconds)

Here's where it gets tricky. And where the exam loves to test you. [PAUSE]

Basis decreases follow a STRICT ORDER. [PAUSE]

Step one. Distributions reduce basis first. But never below zero. Excess distributions become gain. [PAUSE]

Step two. Nondeductible, noncapital expenses. Things like the fifty percent disallowed meals, penalties, and fines. [PAUSE]

Step three. Deductible losses and deductions. This is your ordinary losses and separately stated loss items. [PAUSE] Notice this is AFTER distributions and nondeductible items! [PAUSE]

Step four. The oil and gas depletion deduction. [PAUSE]

Why does order matter? [PAUSE]

Because if someone takes a big distribution first, there may not be enough basis left to absorb losses. Losses get suspended, but the distribution ordering already happened.

Remember, D-N-D-D. [PAUSE] Distributions. Nondeductible. Deductions. Depletion.

---

## SCENE 7: Losses Exceed Basis (35 seconds)

What happens when allocated losses exceed total basis? [PAUSE]

First, losses reduce stock basis. [PAUSE]

If stock basis hits zero, then, and ONLY then, losses can reduce debt basis. [PAUSE]

If the shareholder still has excess losses after both bases hit zero, those losses are suspended. [PAUSE]

They don't disappear. They carry forward indefinitely until the shareholder gets more basis. [PAUSE]

How do you get more basis? Additional capital contributions, additional direct loans, or future income allocations. [PAUSE]

The exam loves to test this. If a shareholder has thirty thousand dollars allocated losses but only twenty thousand dollars total basis, they deduct twenty thousand this year and carry forward ten thousand.

---

## SCENE 8: Debt Basis Restoration (30 seconds)

Here's a nuance the exam tests. The debt basis restoration rule. [PAUSE]

If losses reduce debt basis below its original amount, future income must FIRST restore debt basis before stock basis can increase. [PAUSE]

Let's say a shareholder loaned ten thousand dollars to the corporation. Year one losses reduced their debt basis to zero. [PAUSE]

In year two, they're allocated twenty-five thousand dollars of income. [PAUSE]

The first ten thousand restores debt basis to its original amount. ONLY the remaining fifteen thousand increases stock basis. [PAUSE]

This catches many candidates off guard.

---

## SCENE 9: Example Part 1 (25 seconds)

Let's work through a comprehensive example. This is exactly the kind of problem you'll see on the exam. [PAUSE]

Sarah invests one hundred thousand dollars for stock in an S corporation and makes a direct loan of twenty thousand dollars. Her total beginning basis is one hundred twenty thousand dollars. [PAUSE]

At year end, she receives her K-one showing thirty-five thousand dollars ordinary income, three thousand dollars tax-exempt interest, a fifty thousand dollar cash distribution, five thousand dollars of nondeductible expenses, and eight thousand dollars of charitable contributions. [PAUSE]

What's her ending basis?

---

## SCENE 10: Example Part 2 (40 seconds)

Here's how we solve it. [PAUSE]

Start with stock basis of one hundred thousand dollars. [PAUSE]

First, apply ALL increases. This happens before decreases. [PAUSE]

Add thirty-five thousand ordinary income and three thousand tax-exempt income. Stock basis is now one hundred thirty-eight thousand. [PAUSE]

Now apply decreases IN ORDER. [PAUSE]

Step one. Distributions reduce basis by fifty thousand. Now we're at eighty-eight thousand. [PAUSE]

Step two. Nondeductible expenses reduce basis by five thousand. Down to eighty-three thousand. [PAUSE]

Step three. The charitable contribution, a deduction item, reduces basis by eight thousand. [PAUSE]

Ending stock basis is seventy-five thousand. [PAUSE]

Sarah's debt basis is unchanged at twenty thousand because we never needed it. [PAUSE]

Total ending basis: ninety-five thousand dollars. [PAUSE]

On the exam, work methodically through each step.

---

## SCENE 11: AAA (30 seconds)

For S corporations with accumulated earnings and profits, usually from prior C corporation years, distributions get more complex. [PAUSE]

The Accumulated Adjustments Account, or triple-A, tracks earnings accumulated since the S election. [PAUSE]

Distributions come first from triple-A. These are tax-free to the extent of stock basis, just like regular S corp distributions. [PAUSE]

If triple-A is exhausted, then distributions come from E and P. These are taxed as dividends. [PAUSE]

After E and P, it's return of basis, then capital gain. [PAUSE]

If the S corp was NEVER a C corp, there's no E and P, and you skip the dividend layer. Much simpler.

---

## SCENE 12: Exam Traps (35 seconds)

Let me share the five traps examiners love. [PAUSE]

Trap one. Loan guarantees. [PAUSE] If a question says the shareholder guaranteed a bank loan, that's NOT debt basis. Only direct loans count. [PAUSE]

Trap two. Ordering. [PAUSE] When there are distributions AND losses in the same year, distributions reduce basis first. This can limit loss deductions. [PAUSE]

Trap three. Tax-exempt income is often forgotten. [PAUSE] It DOES increase basis. [PAUSE]

Trap four. The debt basis restoration rule. [PAUSE] Remember, income restores debt basis before it increases stock basis. [PAUSE]

Trap five. Neither stock nor debt basis can go below zero. [PAUSE] Excess amounts are suspended or taxable, not negative.

---

## SCENE 13: Formula Card (20 seconds)

Here's your quick reference formula card. [PAUSE]

Pause here if you need to take a screenshot. [LONGER PAUSE - 2 seconds]

Remember. [PAUSE] Increases happen before decreases. Decreases follow the D-N-D-D order. Debt basis only comes from direct loans. And total basis equals stock plus debt for loss limitation purposes.

---

## SCENE 14: Practice Problem (15 seconds)

Test yourself with this practice problem. [PAUSE]

Pause the video now and work through it step by step. [PAUSE]

Apply the ordering rules, watch for the loss limitation, and calculate Jake's ending basis.

---

## SCENE 15: Solution (35 seconds)

Here's the solution. [PAUSE]

Start with forty thousand stock basis, add the two thousand tax-exempt income. Now forty-two thousand. [PAUSE]

Apply decreases in order. [PAUSE]

Distribution first, down to thirty-two thousand. [PAUSE]
Nondeductible expenses, down to twenty-nine thousand. [PAUSE]

Now for losses. [PAUSE]

Jake has sixty-five thousand allocated loss but only twenty-nine thousand stock basis plus fifteen thousand debt basis, totaling forty-four thousand. [PAUSE]

He deducts forty-four thousand this year. The remaining twenty-one thousand is suspended. [PAUSE]

His ending stock basis is zero. Debt basis is zero. [PAUSE]

The twenty-one thousand carries forward until he gets more basis. [PAUSE]

How'd you do?

---

## SCENE 16: Closing (20 seconds)

You now have the framework to tackle any S Corp basis question on the E-A exam. [PAUSE]

Remember. [PAUSE] Total basis limits losses. [PAUSE] Ordering rules matter. [PAUSE] And only direct loans create debt basis. [PAUSE]

Practice with the basis problems in your question bank, and you'll be ready. [PAUSE]

In our next video, we'll dive deeper into distributions and the triple-A account. [PAUSE]

Good luck, future Enrolled Agent!
