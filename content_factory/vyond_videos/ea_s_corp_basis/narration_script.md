[VISUAL: Animated numbers flying, landing into stacks]

If there's one topic that trips up E-A candidates, it's shareholder basis 
in S corporations. <break time="0.4s"/>

But here's the good news. <break time="0.3s"/>

Once you understand the rules, it's actually a formula you can master. 
Today, we're going to demystify S Corp basis, step by step.

[00:15] [TRANSITION: Wipe to split screen]
[VISUAL: Happy shareholder vs confused shareholder]

Why should you care about basis? <break time="0.4s"/>

Because without sufficient basis, your client cannot deduct their share of 
S corporation losses. <break time="0.5s"/>

A shareholder with fifty thousand dollars in allocated losses, but only ten 
thousand dollars in basis? <break time="0.3s"/> They can only deduct ten thousand. 
The rest gets suspended. <break time="0.3s"/> Potentially forever if they don't 
get more basis.

Basis also determines whether distributions are tax-free or taxable. Get this 
wrong, and your client has an unexpected tax bill.

[00:40] [TRANSITION: Zoom to balance scale]
[VISUAL: Stock certificates on left, loan documents on right]

Shareholders have two types of basis. <break time="0.4s"/>

First, STOCK BASIS. <break time="0.3s"/> This is what the shareholder paid for 
their stock, plus any additional capital contributions.

Second, DEBT BASIS. <break time="0.4s"/> And this is critical. <break time="0.3s"/>

Debt basis ONLY comes from direct loans the shareholder personally makes to 
the S corporation. <break time="0.5s"/>

If the shareholder personally guarantees a bank loan to the corporation, does 
that create debt basis? <break time="0.3s"/> No! <break time="0.3s"/>

The loan must be directly from the shareholder to the corporation. Guarantees 
and indirect loans don't count. <break time="0.4s"/>

Total basis for loss deduction purposes equals stock basis plus debt basis.

[01:15] [VISUAL: Person signing stock certificate, money exchanging]
[ANIMATION: Numbers appearing on stock certificate]

Let's start at the beginning. Initial stock basis depends on HOW the shareholder 
acquired their stock. <break time="0.4s"/>

Purchased for cash? Basis equals what they paid. <break time="0.3s"/>

Contributed property to the corporation? They take the property's adjusted basis. 
Not fair market value. This is like a Section three fifty-one transfer. 
<break time="0.3s"/>

Received as a gift? Carryover the donor's basis. <break time="0.3s"/>

Inherited? Step-up to fair market value at date of death. <break time="0.5s"/>

Let's track an example. Sam purchases one hundred shares of Reynolds S Corp for 
fifty thousand dollars cash. Sam's initial stock basis is fifty thousand dollars.

[01:45] [VISUAL: Bar graph growing with green arrows]
[ANIMATION: Each increase making graph taller]

Now let's talk about what INCREASES basis. <break time="0.4s"/>

Stock basis goes up when the shareholder makes capital contributions. Putting 
more money into the company. <break time="0.3s"/>

It also increases for their allocable share of ALL income items. Both separately 
stated items like capital gains and interest, and the non-separately computed 
income, which is ordinary business income. <break time="0.4s"/>

Here's one people miss. Tax-exempt income ALSO increases basis. <break time="0.3s"/>

Why? Because even though it's not taxable, it represents real economic benefit. 
<break time="0.4s"/>

For debt basis, the only increase is making additional direct loans to the 
corporation. Simple.

In our example, Sam's beginning basis of fifty thousand, plus fifteen thousand 
ordinary income, plus two thousand tax-exempt income, equals sixty-seven thousand 
before decreases.

[02:20] [VISUAL: Waterfall animation - money flowing through 4 tiers]
[ANIMATION: Banner "ORDER MATTERS!" appears]

Here's where it gets tricky. <break time="0.3s"/> And where the exam loves to 
test you. <break time="0.4s"/>

Basis decreases follow a STRICT ORDER. <break time="0.5s"/>

Step one. Distributions reduce basis first. But never below zero. Excess 
distributions become gain. <break time="0.4s"/>

Step two. Nondeductible, noncapital expenses. Things like the fifty percent 
disallowed meals, penalties, and fines. <break time="0.4s"/>

Step three. Deductible losses and deductions. This is your ordinary losses and 
separately stated loss items. <break time="0.3s"/> Notice this is AFTER distributions 
and nondeductible items! <break time="0.4s"/>

Step four. The oil and gas depletion deduction. <break time="0.5s"/>

Why does order matter? <break time="0.4s"/>

Because if someone takes a big distribution first, there may not be enough basis 
left to absorb losses. Losses get suspended, but the distribution ordering already 
happened.

Remember, dee-en-dee-dee. <break time="0.3s"/> Distributions. Nondeductible. 
Deductions. Depletion.

[03:00] [VISUAL: Dam holding back "Suspended Losses"]
[ANIMATION: Losses blocked, flowing into holding tank]

What happens when allocated losses exceed total basis? <break time="0.4s"/>

First, losses reduce stock basis. <break time="0.3s"/>

If stock basis hits zero, then, and ONLY then, losses can reduce debt basis. 
<break time="0.4s"/>

If the shareholder still has excess losses after both bases hit zero, those 
losses are suspended. <break time="0.3s"/>

They don't disappear. They carry forward indefinitely until the shareholder gets 
more basis. <break time="0.4s"/>

How do you get more basis? Additional capital contributions, additional direct 
loans, or future income allocations. <break time="0.5s"/>

The exam loves to test this. <break time="0.3s"/> If a shareholder has thirty 
thousand dollars allocated losses but only twenty thousand dollars total basis, 
they deduct twenty thousand this year and carry forward ten thousand.

[03:35] [VISUAL: Balance scale with debt basis being restored]
[ANIMATION: Timeline showing Year 1 → Year 2]

Here's a nuance the exam tests. <break time="0.3s"/> The debt basis restoration 
rule. <break time="0.4s"/>

If losses reduce debt basis below its original amount, future income must FIRST 
restore debt basis before stock basis can increase. <break time="0.5s"/>

Let's say a shareholder loaned ten thousand dollars to the corporation. Year one 
losses reduced their debt basis to zero. <break time="0.4s"/>

In year two, they're allocated twenty-five thousand dollars of income. 
<break time="0.3s"/>

The first ten thousand restores debt basis to its original amount. ONLY the 
remaining fifteen thousand increases stock basis. <break time="0.4s"/>

This catches many candidates off guard.

[04:05] [VISUAL: Animated spreadsheet building row by row]
[ANIMATION: Sarah character at whiteboard]

Let's work through a comprehensive example. This is exactly the kind of problem 
you'll see on the exam. <break time="0.4s"/>

Sarah invests one hundred thousand dollars for stock in an S corporation and 
makes a direct loan of twenty thousand dollars. Her total beginning basis is 
one hundred twenty thousand dollars. <break time="0.4s"/>

At year end, she receives her K-one showing thirty-five thousand dollars ordinary 
income, three thousand dollars tax-exempt interest, a fifty thousand dollar cash 
distribution, five thousand dollars of nondeductible expenses, and eight thousand 
dollars of charitable contributions. <break time="0.4s"/>

What's her ending basis?

[04:30] [VISUAL: T-account animation with running total]
[ANIMATION: Calculator display updating]

Here's how we solve it. <break time="0.4s"/>

Start with stock basis of one hundred thousand dollars. <break time="0.3s"/>

First, apply ALL increases. This happens before decreases. <break time="0.3s"/>

Add thirty-five thousand ordinary income and three thousand tax-exempt income. 
Stock basis is now one hundred thirty-eight thousand. <break time="0.5s"/>

Now apply decreases IN ORDER. <break time="0.4s"/>

Step one. Distributions reduce basis by fifty thousand. Now we're at eighty-eight 
thousand. <break time="0.3s"/>

Step two. Nondeductible expenses reduce basis by five thousand. Down to 
eighty-three thousand. <break time="0.3s"/>

Step three. The charitable contribution, a deduction item, reduces basis by 
eight thousand. <break time="0.4s"/>

Ending stock basis is seventy-five thousand. <break time="0.3s"/>

Sarah's debt basis is unchanged at twenty thousand because we never needed it. 
<break time="0.3s"/>

Total ending basis: ninety-five thousand dollars. <break time="0.4s"/>

On the exam, work methodically through each step.

[05:10] [VISUAL: Two buckets labeled AAA and E&P]
[ANIMATION: Money pouring from AAA first]

For S corporations with accumulated earnings and profits, usually from prior C 
corporation years, distributions get more complex. <break time="0.4s"/>

The Accumulated Adjustments Account, or triple-A, tracks earnings accumulated 
since the S election. <break time="0.4s"/>

Distributions come first from triple-A. These are tax-free to the extent of stock 
basis, just like regular S corp distributions. <break time="0.3s"/>

If triple-A is exhausted, then distributions come from E and P. These are taxed 
as dividends. <break time="0.3s"/>

After E and P, it's return of basis, then capital gain. <break time="0.4s"/>

If the S corp was NEVER a C corp, there's no E and P, and you skip the dividend 
layer. Much simpler.

[05:40] [VISUAL: Warning signs and caution tape]
[ANIMATION: Danger animations for each trap]

Let me share the five traps examiners love. <break time="0.5s"/>

Trap one. Loan guarantees. <break time="0.3s"/> If a question says the shareholder 
guaranteed a bank loan, that's NOT debt basis. Only direct loans count. 
<break time="0.4s"/>

Trap two. Ordering. <break time="0.3s"/> When there are distributions AND losses 
in the same year, distributions reduce basis first. This can limit loss deductions. 
<break time="0.4s"/>

Trap three. Tax-exempt income is often forgotten. <break time="0.3s"/> It DOES 
increase basis. <break time="0.4s"/>

Trap four. The debt basis restoration rule. <break time="0.3s"/> Remember, income 
restores debt basis before it increases stock basis. <break time="0.4s"/>

Trap five. Neither stock nor debt basis can go below zero. <break time="0.3s"/> 
Excess amounts are suspended or taxable, not negative.

[06:15] [VISUAL: Formula card materializing]
[ANIMATION: Clean, high-contrast design]

Here's your quick reference formula card. <break time="0.4s"/>

Pause here if you need to take a screenshot. <break time="0.6s"/>

Remember. <break time="0.3s"/> Increases happen before decreases. Decreases follow 
the dee-en-dee-dee order. Debt basis only comes from direct loans. And total 
basis equals stock plus debt for loss limitation purposes.

[06:35] [VISUAL: Practice problem on chalkboard]
[ANIMATION: PAUSE icon appears]

Test yourself with this practice problem. <break time="0.3s"/>

Pause the video now and work through it step by step. <break time="0.3s"/>

Apply the ordering rules, watch for the loss limitation, and calculate Jake's 
ending basis.

[06:50] [VISUAL: Solution working out step by step]
[ANIMATION: Each line appearing, green checkmarks]

Here's the solution. <break time="0.4s"/>

Start with forty thousand stock basis, add the two thousand tax-exempt income. 
Now forty-two thousand. <break time="0.3s"/>

Apply decreases in order. <break time="0.3s"/>

Distribution first, down to thirty-two thousand. <break time="0.3s"/>
Nondeductible expenses, down to twenty-nine thousand. <break time="0.4s"/>

Now for losses. <break time="0.3s"/>

Jake has sixty-five thousand allocated loss but only twenty-nine thousand stock 
basis plus fifteen thousand debt basis, totaling forty-four thousand. 
<break time="0.4s"/>

He deducts forty-four thousand this year. The remaining twenty-one thousand is 
suspended. <break time="0.4s"/>

His ending stock basis is zero. Debt basis is zero. <break time="0.3s"/>

The twenty-one thousand carries forward until he gets more basis. <break time="0.4s"/>

How'd you do?

[07:25] [VISUAL: Character thumbs up, checklist completing]
[ANIMATION: Checkmarks appearing, uplifting music]

You now have the framework to tackle any S Corp basis question on the E-A exam. 
<break time="0.4s"/>

Remember. <break time="0.3s"/> Total basis limits losses. <break time="0.2s"/> 
Ordering rules matter. <break time="0.2s"/> And only direct loans create debt 
basis. <break time="0.4s"/>

Practice with the basis problems in your question bank, and you'll be ready. 
<break time="0.4s"/>

In our next video, we'll dive deeper into distributions and the triple-A account. 
<break time="0.3s"/>

Good luck, future Enrolled Agent!
