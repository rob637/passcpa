## SLIDE 2: WHY BASIS MATTERS

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Split screen - left shows happy shareholder taking cash, right shows confused shareholder with denied losses
- **Animation:** Green checkmarks vs. red X marks appearing
- **Prop:** Cash stacks, tax forms, calculator

### On-Screen Text
```
WHY SHAREHOLDER BASIS MATTERS

✓ Determines tax-free distribution amounts
✓ Limits deductible losses
✓ Affects gain on stock sale
✓ Impacts debt repayment taxation

NO BASIS = NO DEDUCTION
```

### Narration Script (25 seconds)
> "Why should you care about basis? Because without sufficient basis, your client cannot deduct their share of S corporation losses. A shareholder with $50,000 in allocated losses but only $10,000 in basis? They can only deduct $10,000. The rest gets suspended - potentially forever if they don't get more basis. Basis also determines whether distributions are tax-free or taxable. Get this wrong, and your client has an unexpected tax bill."

### Key Point Callout
**EXAM TIP:** Basis questions often test whether losses can be deducted - always check basis first!

## SLIDE 3: THE TWO TYPES OF BASIS

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Large balance scale in center
- **Animation:** "Stock Basis" dropping on left side, "Debt Basis" dropping on right side
- **Visual metaphor:** Stock certificates on one side, loan documents on other

### On-Screen Text
```
TWO TYPES OF SHAREHOLDER BASIS

┌─────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────┐
│    STOCK BASIS      │    │    DEBT BASIS       │
├─────────────────────┤    ├─────────────────────┤
│ • Initial investment│    │ • Direct loans FROM │
│ • Inherited stock   │    │   shareholder TO    │
│ • Gifted stock      │    │   corporation       │
│ • Additional        │    │                     │
│   contributions     │    │ NOT: Loans FROM     │
│                     │    │ third parties!      │
└─────────────────────┘    └─────────────────────┘

TOTAL BASIS = Stock Basis + Debt Basis
```

### Narration Script (35 seconds)
> "Shareholders have two types of basis. First, STOCK BASIS - this is what the shareholder paid for their stock, plus any additional capital contributions. Second, DEBT BASIS - and this is critical - debt basis ONLY comes from direct loans the shareholder personally makes to the S corporation. If the shareholder personally guarantees a bank loan to the corporation, does that create debt basis? No! The loan must be directly from the shareholder to the corporation. Guarantees and indirect loans don't count. Total basis for loss deduction purposes equals stock basis plus debt basis."

## SLIDE 4: STARTING POINT - INITIAL BASIS

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Person signing stock certificate, money exchanging hands
- **Animation:** Numbers appearing as each scenario is described
- **Visual:** Stock certificate with "$50,000" appearing on it

### On-Screen Text
```
INITIAL STOCK BASIS

METHOD OF ACQUISITION → INITIAL BASIS

Purchase for cash      → Amount paid
Contribute property    → Adjusted basis of property
Gift                   → Donor's basis (carryover)
Inheritance           → FMV at date of death (step-up)

EXAMPLE:
Sam buys 100 shares for $50,000
Initial Stock Basis = $50,000
```

### Narration Script (30 seconds)
> "Let's start at the beginning. Initial stock basis depends on HOW the shareholder acquired their stock. Purchased for cash? Basis equals what they paid. Contributed property to the corporation? They take the property's adjusted basis - not fair market value. This is like a Section 351 transfer. Received as a gift? Carryover the donor's basis. Inherited? Step-up to fair market value at date of death. Let's track an example: Sam purchases 100 shares of Reynolds S Corp for $50,000 cash. Sam's initial stock basis is $50,000."

## SLIDE 5: BASIS INCREASES

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Animated bar graph growing taller with each increase
- **Animation:** Green arrows pointing UP appear with each item
- **Character:** Accountant pointing to growing chart

### On-Screen Text
```
BASIS INCREASES (Green = Good!)

STOCK BASIS GOES UP FOR:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ↑ Capital contributions            │
│ ↑ Separately stated income items   │
│ ↑ Nonseparately computed income    │
│ ↑ Tax-exempt income                │
│ ↑ Excess depletion over basis      │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

DEBT BASIS INCREASES:
• Only from additional direct loans
  to the corporation
```

### Narration Script (35 seconds)
> "Now let's talk about what INCREASES basis. Stock basis goes up when the shareholder makes capital contributions - putting more money into the company. It also increases for their allocable share of ALL income items - both separately stated items like capital gains and interest, and the nonseparately computed income, which is ordinary business income. Here's one people miss: tax-exempt income ALSO increases basis. Why? Because even though it's not taxable, it represents real economic benefit. For debt basis, the only increase is making additional direct loans to the corporation. Simple."

### Example Box
```
CONTINUING EXAMPLE:
Sam's Beginning Basis:        $50,000
+ Share of ordinary income:   +15,000
+ Share of tax-exempt income:  +2,000
= Basis Before Decreases:     $67,000 ↑
```

## SLIDE 6: BASIS DECREASES - THE ORDERING RULES

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Cascading waterfall animation showing money flowing down through 4 levels
- **Animation:** Each tier fills up before flowing to the next
- **Critical visual:** Large "ORDER MATTERS!" banner

### On-Screen Text
```
BASIS DECREASES - ORDER MATTERS!

Stock basis is reduced IN THIS ORDER:

STEP 1: Distributions
        (first, but cannot go below zero)
               ↓
STEP 2: Nondeductible, noncapital expenses
        (50% meals, penalties, etc.)
               ↓
STEP 3: Deduction and loss items
        (separately stated + ordinary loss)
               ↓
STEP 4: Depletion deduction
        (for oil & gas properties)

⚠️ STOCK BASIS CANNOT GO BELOW ZERO!
```

### Narration Script (40 seconds)
> "Here's where it gets tricky - and where the exam loves to test you. Basis decreases follow a STRICT ORDER. Step one: distributions reduce basis first. But never below zero - excess distributions become gain. Step two: nondeductible, noncapital expenses - things like the 50% disallowed meals, penalties, and fines. Step three: deductible losses and deductions - this is your ordinary losses and separately stated loss items. Notice this is AFTER distributions and nondeductible items! Step four: the oil and gas depletion deduction. Why does order matter? Because if someone takes a big distribution first, there may not be enough basis left to absorb losses. Losses get suspended, but the distribution ordering already happened."

### Memory Aid Box
```
🧠 MEMORY AID: "D-N-D-D" (pronounced "Dundee")
Distributions → Nondeductible → Deductions → Depletion

## SLIDE 7: WHEN LOSSES EXCEED BASIS

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Dam holding back water labeled "Suspended Losses"
- **Animation:** Losses trying to flow through but being blocked, flowing into a holding tank
- **Visual contrast:** Allowed losses (green) vs. Suspended losses (red)

### On-Screen Text
```
WHEN LOSSES EXCEED BASIS

TOTAL BASIS = Stock Basis + Debt Basis

Loss Deduction Limit:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Losses are deducted FIRST against       │
│ stock basis, THEN against debt basis    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

IF LOSSES > TOTAL BASIS:
• Deduct up to total basis
• Excess losses are SUSPENDED
• Suspended losses carry forward
  indefinitely until basis restored
```

### Narration Script (35 seconds)
> "What happens when allocated losses exceed total basis? First, losses reduce stock basis. If stock basis hits zero, then - and ONLY then - losses can reduce debt basis. If the shareholder still has excess losses after both bases hit zero, those losses are suspended. They don't disappear - they carry forward indefinitely until the shareholder gets more basis. How do you get more basis? Additional capital contributions, additional direct loans, or future income allocations. The exam loves to test this: if a shareholder has $30,000 allocated losses but only $20,000 total basis, they deduct $20,000 this year and carry forward $10,000."

### Example Box
```
Sam's Loss Limitation:
Stock Basis:         $67,000
Debt Basis:          $10,000 (direct loan)
Total Basis:         $77,000

Allocated Loss:      $90,000
Deductible Loss:     $77,000 (limited to basis)
Suspended Loss:      $13,000 (carries forward)
```

## SLIDE 8: DEBT BASIS RESTORATION RULE

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Balance scale showing debt basis being restored, then getting reduced again
- **Animation:** Numbers flowing back and forth
- **Character:** Pointing to timeline showing year 1 → year 2

### On-Screen Text
```
DEBT BASIS RESTORATION RULE

WHEN DEBT BASIS IS REDUCED:

Year 1: Losses reduce debt basis
        → Shareholder has "reduced debt basis"

Year 2+: Must RESTORE debt basis before
         stock basis can increase

Net Income Allocation Order:
1. First, restore debt basis to original amount
2. Then, increase stock basis

⚠️ Restoration is MANDATORY before stock increases!
```

### Narration Script (30 seconds)
> "Here's a nuance the exam tests: the debt basis restoration rule. If losses reduce debt basis below its original amount, future income must FIRST restore debt basis before stock basis can increase. Let's say a shareholder loaned $10,000 to the corporation. Year one losses reduced their debt basis to zero. In year two, they're allocated $25,000 of income. The first $10,000 restores debt basis to its original amount. ONLY the remaining $15,000 increases stock basis. This catches many candidates off guard."

## SLIDE 9: COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLE - PART 1

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Animated spreadsheet/ledger building row by row
- **Animation:** Numbers typing in one at a time as narrator speaks
- **Character:** Sarah (professional woman) writing on whiteboard

### On-Screen Text
```
COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLE: SARAH'S S CORP INVESTMENT

STARTING POINT (January 1):
Stock Basis:     $100,000 (initial investment)
Debt Basis:      $20,000 (direct loan to S corp)
Total Basis:     $120,000

YEAR 1 ACTIVITY - Sarah's Share (K-1):
• Ordinary business income:     $35,000
• Tax-exempt interest income:    $3,000
• Cash distribution received:   $50,000
• Nondeductible expenses:        $5,000
• Charitable contributions:      $8,000
```

### Narration Script (25 seconds)
> "Let's work through a comprehensive example - this is exactly the kind of problem you'll see on the exam. Sarah invests $100,000 for stock in an S corporation and makes a direct loan of $20,000. Her total beginning basis is $120,000. At year end, she receives her K-1 showing $35,000 ordinary income, $3,000 tax-exempt interest, an $50,000 cash distribution, $5,000 of nondeductible expenses, and $8,000 of charitable contributions. What's her ending basis?"

## SLIDE 10: COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLE - PART 2

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** T-account animation showing increases on left, decreases on right
- **Animation:** Each line item flying into position, running total updating
- **Visual:** Large calculator display showing running total

### On-Screen Text
```
STEP-BY-STEP CALCULATION

BEGIN: Stock Basis        $100,000
       Debt Basis          $20,000

INCREASES (apply all first):
+ Ordinary income         +$35,000
+ Tax-exempt income        +$3,000
                         ─────────
Stock Basis (after inc.)  $138,000

DECREASES (in order):
- Distribution (Step 1)   -$50,000  → $88,000
- Nondeductible (Step 2)   -$5,000  → $83,000
- Charitable (Step 3)      -$8,000  → $75,000

ENDING STOCK BASIS:        $75,000
DEBT BASIS (unchanged):    $20,000
TOTAL ENDING BASIS:        $95,000
```

### Narration Script (40 seconds)
> "Here's how we solve it. Start with stock basis of $100,000. First, apply ALL increases - this happens before decreases. Add $35,000 ordinary income and $3,000 tax-exempt income. Stock basis is now $138,000. Now apply decreases IN ORDER. Step one: distributions reduce basis by $50,000 - now we're at $88,000. Step two: nondeductible expenses reduce basis by $5,000 - down to $83,000. Step three: the charitable contribution - a deduction item - reduces basis by $8,000. Ending stock basis is $75,000. Sarah's debt basis is unchanged at $20,000 because we never needed it. Total ending basis: $95,000. On the exam, work methodically through each step."

## SLIDE 11: DISTRIBUTIONS AND AAA (Advanced)

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Two buckets labeled "AAA" and "E&P" with distributions flowing from AAA first
- **Animation:** Water/money pouring from AAA bucket, then E&P bucket
- **Character:** Pointing to the ordering

### On-Screen Text
```
DISTRIBUTIONS: AAA vs. E&P

FOR S CORPS WITH ACCUMULATED E&P
(from prior C corporation years):

Distribution Ordering Rules:
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. First: from AAA (tax-free to   │
│    extent of stock basis)         │
│ 2. Second: from E&P (dividend)    │
│ 3. Third: return of basis         │
│ 4. Finally: capital gain          │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

AAA = Accumulated Adjustments Account
    = Tracks post-S election earnings

NO E&P? → Skip step 2 (simpler!)
```

### Narration Script (30 seconds)
> "For S corporations with accumulated earnings and profits - usually from prior C corporation years - distributions get more complex. The Accumulated Adjustments Account, or AAA, tracks earnings accumulated since the S election. Distributions come first from AAA - these are tax-free to the extent of stock basis, just like regular S corp distributions. If AAA is exhausted, then distributions come from E&P - these are taxed as dividends. After E&P, it's return of basis, then capital gain. If the S corp was NEVER a C corp, there's no E&P, and you skip the dividend layer. Much simpler."

## SLIDE 12: EXAM STRATEGY & KEY TRAPS

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Warning signs and caution tape
- **Animation:** Each trap appearing with a "danger" animation
- **Character:** Holding up fingers counting off traps

### On-Screen Text
```
EXAM TRAPS TO AVOID ⚠️

TRAP #1: Loan Guarantees
"Shareholder guarantees bank loan..."
→ NO debt basis! Must be DIRECT loan.

TRAP #2: Order of Decreases
Watch for: distributions + losses in same year
→ Distribution reduces basis FIRST

TRAP #3: Tax-Exempt Income
"Tax-exempt interest of $5,000..."
→ DOES increase basis! (commonly missed)

TRAP #4: Debt Basis Restoration
"In year 2, ordinary income of $50,000..."
→ Restore debt basis FIRST before stock

TRAP #5: Below-Zero Confusion
→ Stock basis can't go negative
→ Debt basis can't go negative
→ Neither can go below zero!
```

### Narration Script (35 seconds)
> "Let me share the five traps examiners love. Trap one: loan guarantees. If a question says the shareholder guaranteed a bank loan, that's NOT debt basis - only direct loans count. Trap two: ordering. When there are distributions AND losses in the same year, distributions reduce basis first. This can limit loss deductions. Trap three: tax-exempt income is often forgotten - it DOES increase basis. Trap four: the debt basis restoration rule - remember, income restores debt basis before it increases stock basis. Trap five: neither stock nor debt basis can go below zero. Excess amounts are suspended or taxable, not negative."

S CORP SHAREHOLDER BASIS - QUICK REFERENCE

════════════════════════════════════════
STOCK BASIS INCREASES:
  + Capital contributions
  + Ordinary income
  + Separately stated income
  + Tax-exempt income
  
STOCK BASIS DECREASES (IN ORDER):
  1. Distributions (not below zero)
  2. Nondeductible, noncapital expenses
  3. Loss/deduction items
  4. Depletion
════════════════════════════════════════

DEBT BASIS:

## SLIDE 15: PRACTICE PROBLEM - SOLUTION

### Visual Direction
- **Scene:** Solution working out step by step
- **Animation:** Each calculation line appearing sequentially
- **Green checkmarks:** Appearing next to correct answers

### On-Screen Text
```
SOLUTION

START:  Stock Basis $40,000 + Tax-exempt $2,000 = $42,000

DECREASES (ORDER):
1. Distribution:     $42,000 - $10,000 = $32,000
2. Nondeductible:    $32,000 - $3,000  = $29,000
3. Loss deduction:   Available basis for loss
   Stock Basis:      $29,000 ← use first
   Debt Basis:       $15,000
   Total:            $44,000

ANSWERS:
1. Deductible loss:  $44,000 ✓
2. Suspended loss:   $65,000 - $44,000 = $21,000 ✓
3. Ending basis:
   Stock: $0 (reduced to zero by losses)
   Debt:  $0 (losses used remaining $15k)
   
   Jake carries forward $21,000 of suspended losses.
```

### Narration Script (35 seconds)
> "Here's the solution. Start with $40,000 stock basis, add the $2,000 tax-exempt income - now $42,000. Apply decreases in order: distribution first, down to $32,000. Nondeductible expenses, down to $29,000. Now for losses: Jake has $65,000 allocated loss but only $29,000 stock basis plus $15,000 debt basis, totaling $44,000. He deducts $44,000 this year. The remaining $21,000 is suspended. His ending stock basis is zero, debt basis is zero. The $21,000 carries forward until he gets more basis. How'd you do?"
