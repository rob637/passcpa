## CFP (Certified Financial Planner)
**Total questions:** 2485

CFP uses qualitative blueprint weights (High/Medium), so comparison is at section level.

## Summary

| Exam | Questions | Structural | Blueprint Alignment | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CPA | 4,985 | Clean | 14 MISALIGNED areas — flat distribution ignores blueprint weights | HIGH |
| EA | 2,189 | Clean | 4 MISALIGNED areas — SEE2-1 critically low (14% vs 35%) | HIGH |
| CMA | 2,024 | Clean | Minor (within 6pp) — CMA2-C/D/E slightly off | LOW |
| CIA | 1,522 | Clean | Minor (within 7pp) — CIA1-V over, CIA1-I under | LOW |
| CISA | 1,520 | Clean | All -B sub-areas have 0 questions (config defines A+B per domain) | MEDIUM |
| CFP | 2,485 | Clean | Good — within 3.4pp at section level | LOW |

### Key Actions Needed

1. **CPA (HIGH):** Questions are distributed roughly equally across blueprint areas within each section, but the actual CPA exam heavily weights certain areas (e.g., FAR-II should be ~35%, BAR-I should be ~45%). The adaptive engine should weight question selection by blueprint area to match exam proportions. Adding more questions to underrepresented areas (FAR-II, FAR-III, AUD-II, AUD-III, BAR-I, BAR-II, ISC-I, ISC-II, REG-IV) would also help.

2. **EA (HIGH):** SEE2-1 (Individual Tax Returns) at 14% vs 35% target is a critical gap — this is the highest-weighted area on the SEE Part 2 exam. SEE3-2 (Specific Areas of Representation) is also underrepresented at 17% vs 29%. Need ~150 more SEE2-1 questions and ~85 more SEE3-2 questions.

3. **CISA (MEDIUM):** All 1,520 CISA questions are tagged with only the -A sub-area per domain (e.g., CISA1-A). The config defines both A and B sub-areas. Questions should be redistributed between A and B based on their actual topic content, or the config should be updated to use single-area tagging per domain.

4. **CMA (LOW):** CMA2-C (Decision Analysis) is slightly under at 18.5% vs 25% target. CMA2-D and CMA2-E are over. Minor rebalancing needed.

5. **CIA (LOW):** CIA1-V (Governance, Risk, and Control) is somewhat over at 27% vs 20%. CIA1-I (Mission/Definition) is slightly under at 36% vs 40%. Minor adjustments.

6. **CFP (LOW):** Well-balanced at section level. Minor gaps in CFP-INV and CFP-RET (~3pp each).
