## 🎯 Study Strategy by Exam Date

### Testing January - March 2026 (2025 Blueprint)

✅ **Focus on 2025 Blueprint content only**
- Do NOT study H.R. 1 provisions
- Use **pre-OBBBA tax law**:
  - $10,000 SALT cap
  - 20% QBI deduction
  - 40% bonus depreciation
  - Current SS taxation rules (up to 85%)
  - 2025 standard deduction amounts

⚠️ **Watch out**: Don't use review materials that mention "2026 changes" or "OBBBA" for your calculations

### Testing April - June 2026 (2025 Blueprint)

✅ **Still 2025 Blueprint** - Same as Q1
- If considering rescheduling REG/TCP to July+ → weigh pros/cons
- Begin familiarizing with 2026 changes IF planning potential retake

### Testing July - September 2026 (2026 Blueprint)

✅ **NOW study H.R. 1 (OBBBA) provisions**
- Use **post-OBBBA tax law**:
  - $40,000 SALT cap
  - 23% QBI deduction
  - 100% bonus depreciation
  - New SS taxation exemptions
  - Permanent enhanced standard deduction

### Testing October - December 2026 (2026 Blueprint)

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: I'm testing in June 2026. Should I wait until July to take REG/TCP?

**Consider:**
- ✅ Study existing 2025 content now, test before July
- ⚠️ If you fail and retake after July, you'll need to learn new rules
- Decision factors: Your readiness, pass likelihood, study time available

### Q: Do FAR, AUD, BAR, or ISC have different blueprints?

**Minimal differences.** These sections have the same substantive content in both 2025 and 2026 Blueprints. Focus on core concepts.

### Q: I'm using a review course. How do I know which Blueprint it covers?

- Check for "2026 Blueprint" or "OBBBA/H.R. 1" mentions
- If the course mentions $40K SALT cap, 23% QBI → It's 2026 content
- If the course mentions $10K SALT cap, 20% QBI → It's 2025 content
- **Ask your provider** which Blueprint edition you have

### Q: What if I answer based on the wrong Blueprint?

- The exam tests based on **your testing date**
- Using wrong numbers = wrong answers
- This is especially critical for calculations
