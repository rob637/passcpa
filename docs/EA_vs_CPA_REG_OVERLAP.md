# EA vs. CPA REG Alignment Guide

This guide outlines the significant content overlap between the Enrolled Agent (EA) exam (Special Enrollment Examination - SEE) and the Regulation (REG) section of the CPA exam.

## Overview
There is approximately **75-80% content overlap** between the EA exam and CPA REG. Candidates studying for one are well-positioned to pivot to the other with minimal incremental study.

| Feature | Enrolled Agent (SEE) | CPA Regulation (REG) |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Focus** | 100% Tax & Representation | ~80% Tax, ~20% Business Law |
| **Structure** | 3 Parts (Indiv, Bus, Rep) | 1 Section (part of Core) |
| **Questions** | 100 MCQs per part | MCQs + Task-Based Simulations |
| **Testing Window** | May 1 – Feb 28 | Year-round (Continuous) |

## Content Mapping

### 1. Individuals (SEE Part 1 vs. REG)
**Overlap: 95%**
Both exams heavily cover individual taxation.
- **Shared Topics:**
    - Gross Income (Inclusions/Exclusions)
    - Adjustments & Deductions (Standard/Itemized)
    - Tax Credits (Child Tax Credit, EITC, etc.)
    - Filing Status & Dependents
    - Property Transactions (Basis, Gain/Loss)
    - Passive Activity Losses

### 2. Businesses (SEE Part 2 vs. REG)
**Overlap: 90%**
The specialized entity taxation is critical for both.
- **Shared Topics:**
    - C Corporations (formation, taxation, distributions)
    - S Corporations (eligibility, basis, K-1s)
    - Partnerships (formation, basis, distributions)
    - LLCs & Sole Proprietorships
    - Estate & Trust Taxation

- **Differences:**
    - CPA REG tests more heavily on **Business Law** (Contracts, Agency, debtor-creditor relationships) which is NOT on the EA exam.

### 3. Representation (SEE Part 3 vs. REG)
**Overlap: 50%**
This is where the exams diverge most significantly in *depth*.
- **SEE Part 3** is entirely dedicated to IRS Practice & Procedures (Circular 230).
- **CPA REG** covers Circular 230 but also includes federal tax procedures and other ethical standards.
- **Key EA Exclusives:** 
    - Detailed appeal procedures
    - Specific forms for representation (2848 vs 8821 in depth)
    - Sanction nuances

## Detailed Topic Differences

### Exclusively on CPA REG (Not on EA)
* **Business Law:**
    * **Contracts:** Formation, performance, breach, and remedies.
    * **Agency:** Principal-agent relationship, duties, authority, and liability.
    * **Debtor-Creditor Relationships:** Suretyship, garnishment, and bankruptcy (Chapter 7, 11, 13).
    * **Federal Securities Regulations:** 1933 and 1934 Acts (Liability rules).
* **Ethics:**
    * **AICPA Code of Professional Conduct:** Independence, integrity, and objectivity rules specific to CPAs.
    * **State Board Rules:** Continuing Professional Education (CPE) and licensure requirements.

### Exclusively on EA SEE (Not on CPA REG, or very light)
* **IRS Procedures (Deep Dive):**
    * **Collection Process:** Detailed rules on Liens, Levies, Offers in Compromise (OIC), and Installment Agreements.
    * **Appeals:** Specific protest requirements (Small case vs. Formal), timelines (30-day vs. 90-day letters), and Tax Court procedures.
    * **e-Services:** Rules for Authorized IRS e-file Providers and suitability checks.
    * **Practitioner Sanctions:** Specific nuances of censure, suspension, and disbarment under Circular 230 §10.50.

## Strategy for Dual Candidates

### Strategy A: EA First, then CPA
1. **Master the Tax Code:** Passing all 3 SEE parts gives you a "deep dive" mastery of tax that exceeds the depth of many CPA review courses.
2. **Bridge the Gap:** To pass REG after EA, you only need to study:
    - Business Law (Contracts, UCC, Agency)
    - Federal Tax Procedures (simulations focus)
    - Ethics beyond Circular 230

### Strategy B: CPA REG First, then EA
1. **Tax Foundation:** Studying REG provides a broad base.
2. **Deepen Representation:** You will need to drill down into the specific procedural details of SEE Part 3, which is tested more granularly than on REG.
