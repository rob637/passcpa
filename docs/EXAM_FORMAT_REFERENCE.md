## Content Development Guidelines

When developing content for each exam:

### CPA
- Build MCQ and TBS content
- TBS should include: journal entries, reconciliations, document review, research, calculations
- **Note:** Written Communication (WC) was retired with BEC on December 15, 2023
- **Note:** OLD blueprint through 6/30/26, NEW blueprint 7/1/26 - plan content updates

### EA
- Focus on MCQ only
- Tax form knowledge tested via MCQ, not form completion simulations
- Any "form practice" should be labeled as educational/supplementary (not exam simulation)
- Build content for all 3 parts; Part 2 (Businesses) is most challenging

### CMA
- Build MCQ AND essay/CBQ content (both are scored)
- MCQ: Focus on calculation-heavy questions (variances, ratios, CVP analysis)
- Essays/CBQs: Business scenario analysis with calculations + written responses
- Students must score 50%+ on MCQ for essays to count

### CFP
- Stand-alone MCQ questions
- Short scenarios with 3-7 related MCQs
- Case study vignettes: Multi-page scenarios with 8-12 MCQ questions
- All answers are 4-option multiple choice
- Emphasize time management (90 min per 85-question subsection)

### CIA
- Pure MCQ for all 3 parts
- Questions often present scenarios/situations but answer is still MCQ
- Part 1 is longest (125 questions, 2.5 hours)

### CISA
- Pure MCQ (150 questions, 4 hours)
- Focus heavily on Domains 4 & 5 (52% of exam)
- Scenario-based questions requiring best-practice selection
