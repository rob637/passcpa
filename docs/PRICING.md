## Final Pricing Matrix

### Annual Plans (Primary Offering)

| Exam | Regular | Founder (Apr 1 - May 31) | Monthly | Savings vs Competitors |
|------|---------|--------------------------|---------|------------------------|
| **CPA** | $199/yr | $99/yr | $29/mo | 87-92% cheaper |
| **CFP** | $149/yr | $75/yr | $19/mo | 90-93% cheaper |
| **CMA** | $99/yr | $49/yr | $15/mo | 85-92% cheaper |
| **CIA** | $99/yr | $49/yr | $15/mo | 83-90% cheaper |
| **CISA** | $79/yr | $39/yr | $12/mo | 80-87% cheaper |
| **EA** | $59/yr | $29/yr | $9/mo | 85-90% cheaper |

### Why This Pricing?

- **CPA at $199:** Flagship product, 7 sections, 2,900+ questions, most content
- **CFP at $149:** 8 domains, comprehensive case studies, high-value credential
- **CMA/CIA at $99:** 2-3 parts each, professional credentials, mid-tier complexity
- **CISA at $79:** Single exam, IT audit niche
- **EA at $59:** 3 parts, aggressive pricing to drive volume

---

## Why No Lifetime Pricing

**Decision: Lifetime plans are NOT offered.**

| Risk | Impact |
|------|--------|
| **Login sharing** | One person pays $299, shares with 5 friends forever |
| **Revenue leak** | They study for 18 months, pass, we never see them again |
| **Content updates** | We keep updating; they pay nothing |
| **No recurring relationship** | Harder to build long-term business |

**If we reconsider later:** Add significant friction (single device, $499+, re-verify every 90 days).

---

## Pass Guarantee: "Pass or Study Free Until You Do"

### Why NOT Money-Back Refunds

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Abuse potential | Sign up, do nothing, fail, demand refund |
| Administratively complex | Legal, accounting, disputes |
| Cash leaves business | Hurts cash flow |
| Hard to verify | Did they really try? |

### Our Guarantee: Extended Subscription

> **"Pass or Study Free Until You Do"**
>
> If you don't pass, we'll extend your subscription at no cost until you do.

**Requirements to claim:**

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Complete 80%+ of lessons for that section/part | Proves engagement |
| Answer 80%+ of practice questions | Can't just skim |
| Take at least 2 full mock exams | Simulated exam experience |
| Achieve 70%+ average on practice questions | Shows genuine effort |
| Exam taken within subscription period | Prevents "save for later" |
| Submit score report within 30 days | Proof of attempt |

**Extension terms:**
- 6-month extension per claim
- Up to 2 extensions per section/part (12 months total free)
- After that, re-subscribe at 50% off

**Why this works:**
- Costs us almost nothing (marginal hosting cost is pennies)
- Keeps them in our ecosystem (they don't switch to competitor)
- Eventually they pass → testimonial
- Filters out abuse (must actually engage with content)
- Low admin burden (update date in database)

---

## Trial Period

**Decision: 14 days full access, no credit card required**

| Day | Access Level |
|-----|--------------|
| Days 1-14 | Full access to everything |
| Day 15+ (not subscribed) | Limited: 20% of questions, 30% of lessons, no AI tutor |
| Subscribed | Full access restored |

**Why 14 days (not 7 or 30):**
- 7 days: Too short to see value, creates pressure
- 30 days: Too long, may not convert
- 14 days: Enough to try several study sessions, feel the quality

## Honest Competitive Assessment

### Where We Genuinely Win

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Price** | Crushing victory | 80-95% cheaper than market |
| **AI Tutor (Vory)** | Clear differentiator | Nobody else has this |
| **Modern UI/UX** | Significant advantage | Mobile-first, clean design |
| **2025 + 2026 Blueprint** | Competitive moat | Both covered with transition logic |
| **Spaced Repetition (SM-2)** | Differentiated | Rare in exam prep |
| **Speed of Updates** | Advantage | AI-assisted, agile |

### Where We're Competitive But Not Dominant

| Feature | Our Position | Reality Check |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| **Question Bank** | 2,900 (CPA) | Gleim has 9,000+; we're solid but not largest |
| **TBS Simulations** | 30+ | Competitors have 100+; theirs more extensive |
| **Explanations** | Good | Theirs polished by decades of iteration |

### Where We're Honestly Behind

| Feature | Gap | Mitigation |
|---------|-----|------------|
| **Video Content** | Major | AI tutor explains on demand; some learners need video though |
| **Brand Trust** | Real | Time + testimonials will fix; we're new |
| **Pass Rate Data** | Critical | Need beta users to pass and share results |
| **Employer Recognition** | Unknown | "My firm uses Becker" — we're not on HR lists yet |
| **Question Volume** | Behind | 2,900 vs 7,000+ (Wiley/Gleim) — expand over time |

### The Video Question

**Honest take:** Lack of video is a limitation but not dealbreaker for most candidates.

- Video-first learners (visual, auditory) will miss it
- Roger Philipp built a cult following being entertaining
- BUT: Active recall beats passive video for retention
- Our AI tutor can explain anything on demand, personalized
- Many candidates skip videos anyway, go straight to practice

**Our target market:** Price-conscious, self-motivated candidates who prefer active learning over passive watching and value AI assistance. That's a big market.

## App Store & Distribution Strategy

### The Apple/Google Tax Problem

| Purchase Location | Platform Cut | Your Revenue (on $199) |
|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Web (voraprep.com)** | Stripe 3% | $193 |
| **Android app** | Google 15% | $169 |
| **iOS app (year 1)** | Apple 30% | $139 |
| **iOS app (year 2+)** | Apple 15% | $169 |

### Strategy: Web-First

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| **April 1, 2026** | Launch paid plans on **web only** (voraprep.com, Stripe) |
| **April 1** | Apps remain in stores, free to download |
| **April 1** | Apps check subscription status, gate premium content |
| **May/June** | Consider adding in-app purchase (accept the tax) |

### How Apps Work

| User Status | App Experience |
|-------------|----------------|
| Logged in + subscribed (via web) | Full access |
| Logged in + not subscribed | Limited content, no explicit paywall (they figure out web) |
| Not logged in | "Sign in to access" |

**Key insight:** Don't show pricing in iOS app. Don't link to website for purchase. App is for studying, not buying. This avoids Apple's rules while keeping full revenue on web purchases.

### PWA Reality

| User Behavior | Percentage |
|---------------|------------|
| Knows how to install PWA | ~10-15% |
| Will install if prompted | ~20-30% |
| Uses browser, never installs | ~50-60% |
| Prefers native apps only | ~20% |

**PWA in browser (without install) looks less professional** — URL bar visible, not full-screen.

**Mitigation:**
1. Show iOS "Add to Home Screen" tutorial after 2-3 sessions
2. Keep apps in stores as credibility signal
3. Accept that some users will buy via app store (cost of business)
4. Focus web as primary acquisition channel (ads → web → email → purchase)

### The 30% Tax Is Annoying But Not Fatal

At $199/year, margins are healthy enough to absorb it:
- Web purchase: $193 net
- iOS purchase: $139 net (year 1) → $169 (year 2+)

A customer who pays via Apple is still a customer. Don't overthink it.

## Login Sharing Prevention

| Method | Effort | Effectiveness |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Single active session** | Low | Medium — logs out other device |
| **Device limit (3 max)** | Medium | Good — reasonable limit |
| **Email re-verify every 90 days** | Low | Medium — friction for sharers |

**Launch with:** Single active session + 3 device limit. Add more if abuse detected.

## Revenue Projections

### Year 1 Scenarios (2026)

| **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** | ~$150/year (blended) |
| **Target CAC** | <$50 |
| **Target LTV:CAC** | >3:1 |
| **Breakeven users** | ~200-300 (before ad spend) |

### Cost Structure

| Cost Category | Monthly Estimate |
|---------------|------------------|
| Firebase (hosting, auth, Firestore) | $200-500 |
| Gemini AI API (Vory) | $100-500 (scales with usage) |

## Open Questions (Future Decisions)

| Question | Current Thinking |
|----------|------------------|
| **Group/Corporate pricing?** | Not for launch; revisit when firms ask |
| **Student discount?** | Already very cheap; maybe .edu = 20% off later |
| **Referral program?** | Yes, but post-launch; "Give 1 month, get 1 month" |
| **In-app purchase?** | Not for launch; add May/June if demand |
| **CFA course?** | If added: $149/level or $349/all 3 levels |
