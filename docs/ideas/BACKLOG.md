Reddit Post - Seriously - one Reddit post in the right subreddit can get you 50+ users overnight. These communities are hungry for free resources.

Sample Post (You Can Use This):
Title: Free CPA review app - looking for beta testers

Hey everyone, I've been working on a CPA study app and want to get feedback before official launch. It's completely free during beta.

Features:

300+ lessons mapped to 2026 Blueprint
Practice questions with explanations
Exam simulator
AI tutor for explanations
Would love honest feedback on what works and what doesn't. Link in comments.

(Not affiliated with any big review course, just a solo project)

You don't have to reply to every comment. A simple "thanks for the feedback!" works.

Why are we mocking so much in our testing scrips - is that normal?  will it impact our app?


Gemini - we have been working on this app for a while.  I think we are close to World Class but I want you to do a complete review of the app looking at all aspects including but not limited to the flow of user experience, the user interface, the code structure and compilation, the testing, the depth and quality of the lesson content, the depth and quality of the questions content, clarification and full inclusion of the 2025 AICPA Blueprint and the 2026 AICPA Blueprint, ease of use of the app, meeting accessibility standards, solid settings and administration capabilities, etc.  this needs to be viewed as meeting World Class Standards including Google and Apple quality.  Very professional with wide moats between the competitors Becker, Gleim, UWorld, Surgent, Ninja, etc.  Please provide ratings and percentages for each area on how close we are to meeting world class standards and Google quality.  Please identify any placeholders or mock data.
