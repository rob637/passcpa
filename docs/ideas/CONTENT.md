### Top 5 Deep Dive

#### #1: CMA - Build This First ⭐

**Why:** 
- Same buyers (accountants considering career paths)
- 35-40% content reusable (financial statements, cost accounting, budgeting)
- Natural bundle: "Passed CPA? Get CMA for $50 more"
- IMA (governing body) is less dominant than AICPA, easier to partner
- Many employers want CPA + CMA combo

**Estimated effort:** 6-8 weeks content creation  
**Revenue potential:** $50-100K ARR in year 1

#### #2: EA - Fastest to Build ⭐

**Why:**
- 40%+ of content is straight from REG section
- Tax professionals are your REG users already
- Very few modern EA prep options (Gleim, Surgent are dated)
- Lower price tolerance ($200-400) but high volume
- 3 parts, all tax-focused

**Estimated effort:** 4-6 weeks content creation  
**Revenue potential:** $30-60K ARR in year 1

#### #3: CIA - Growing Market ⭐

**Why:**
- Internal audit is booming (SOX compliance, ESG)
- AUD content overlaps significantly
- IIA (governing body) less competitive than accounting
- Strong pathway for accountants pivoting from public accounting
- 3 parts, reasonable scope

**Estimated effort:** 8-10 weeks content creation  
**Revenue potential:** $40-80K ARR in year 1

#### #4: CPA Canada (CFE) - Geographic Expansion

**Why:**
- IFRS vs GAAP differences are manageable
- Canadian accountants have fewer options
- Same study patterns, similar exam structure
- Opens entire Canadian market
- Prep for eventual global expansion

**Estimated effort:** 8-12 weeks (mostly adaptation, not new content)  
**Revenue potential:** $30-50K ARR in year 1

#### #5: CISA - Hot Market Opportunity

**Why:**
- Cybersecurity + audit = high demand
- Your ISC section content overlaps
- IT auditors earn more than financial auditors
- ISACA certification is growing 20% annually
- Less price-sensitive market ($500-1000 courses common)

**Estimated effort:** 10-12 weeks content creation  
**Revenue potential:** $50-100K ARR in year 1

### The "Don't Build" List

| Course | Why Not |

| **Bar Exam** | Completely different profession, would require legal expertise |
| **MCAT** | Medical field, no synergy, dominated by Kaplan/Princeton |
| **PMP** | Saturated market, no content overlap, commoditized pricing |
