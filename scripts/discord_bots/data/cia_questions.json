    "options": [
      "The risk that RPA bots will develop independent decision-making capabilities",
      "The risk that automated processes may perpetuate and scale errors if underlying business rules are flawed",
      "The risk that RPA will eliminate all human involvement in financial reporting",
      "The risk that RPA bots will conflict with each other's processing schedules"
