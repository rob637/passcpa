The most likely amount for a binary outcome (achieves or does not) is the single most likely outcome. Since there is an 80% probability of achieving the bonus, the most likely outcome is that the bonus WILL be earned. Transaction price = $900,000 + $150,000 = $1,050,000, subject to the constraint that it is highly probable a significant reversal will not occur.
