    "correctAnswer": 3,
    "explanation": "ISAs (issued by the IAASB — International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board) vs. GAAS (issued by AICPA ASB for non-issuers): Key differences: (1) Terminology: Key Audit Matters (KAMs) vs. no current GAAS equivalent (PCAOB has CAMs), (2) Going concern: ISA 570 requires explicit statement about management's use of going concern assumption, (3) ISAs are generally more principles-based, GAAS more rules-based, (4) ISA 701 KAMs are required for all listed entities; GAAS does not require equivalent for non-issuers, (5) ISA report format differs slightly (responsibilities, scope). US GAAS is converging toward ISAs. PCAOB standards apply to public company audits."

    "explanation": "ASC 820 establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities — the most reliable measurement. Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 quotes — includes quoted prices for similar assets, quoted prices in inactive markets, or observable market data (interest rates, yield curves, credit spreads). Level 3: Unobservable inputs — the entity's own assumptions about what market participants would use, subject to more extensive disclosure. Entities must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize unobservable inputs."

In the eliminating entry: Debit Sales $100,000, Credit COGS $91,000, Credit Inventory $9,000. Since this is an UPSTREAM sale, the subsidiary recorded the profit. Therefore, the unrealized profit elimination reduces the subsidiary's income, which affects both the controlling and noncontrolling interests in proportion to their ownership: NCI absorbs 20% × $9,000 = $1,800 of the eliminated profit. For downstream sales (parent sells to subsidiary), the parent absorbs 100% of the elimination — NCI is not affected."

For example, if group materiality is $1 million and there are 10 components, each could have up to $1 million in undetected misstatements (total $10 million). Setting component materiality lower (e.g., $200,000 to $500,000) reduces this aggregation risk.

    "explanation": "ASC 715 requires recognition of the funded status on the balance sheet. Funded status = Fair value of plan assets − Projected benefit obligation (PBO). If plan assets > PBO: noncurrent asset (prepaid pension). If PBO > plan assets: current liability (to the extent of next year's expected contributions) and noncurrent liability (remainder). Items not yet recognized as components of net periodic pension cost (prior service cost, actuarial gains/losses) are recorded in AOCI. The PBO is used (not the ABO) because it includes future salary increases in the benefit formula — providing a more complete measure of the obligation."

    "explanation": "Cost of not taking discount = [Discount % ÷ (100% − Discount %)] × [365 ÷ (Full payment period − Discount period)]. = [2% ÷ 98%] × [365 ÷ (30 − 10)] = 0.020408 × 18.25 = 0.3724 or approximately 36.7%. This means a buyer who forgoes the 2% discount to pay on day 30 (instead of day 10) is effectively borrowing at an annualized rate of about 36.7%. This is extremely expensive compared to typical borrowing rates, so the discount should almost always be taken if cash or bank borrowing is available at a lower rate."

(2) Human error — mistakes in judgment, fatigue, distraction. (3) Collusion — two or more people working together can circumvent segregation of duties. (4) Cost-benefit constraints — controls should not cost more than the benefit they provide. (5) Unusual or non-routine transactions that existing controls may not address. Management override is particularly significant because it means that even well-designed controls can be rendered ineffective by the people who operate the system.

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "explanation": "Interface/integration controls ensure data transferred between systems is complete, accurate, and authorized. Key controls: (1) Completeness — record counts, control totals (hash totals, batch totals) compared between sending and receiving systems, (2) Accuracy — validation of data types, formats, and values on receipt, (3) Authorization — only authorized interfaces can send/receive data, (4) Error handling — exception reports for failed transfers, error queues, reprocessing procedures, (5) Timeliness — monitoring to ensure transfers complete within expected windows, (6) Reconciliation — automated or manual reconciliation between systems (e.g., AP subledger to GL). Types: (1) Batch interfaces — periodic file transfers (nightly, hourly), (2) Real-time interfaces — API calls, message queu..."

    "explanation": "Programmer access to production without segregation is a pervasive general IT control weakness. General IT controls (access security, program change, computer operations) affect ALL applications running in that environment. If compromised, the auditor cannot rely on IT-dependent controls throughout the system."
