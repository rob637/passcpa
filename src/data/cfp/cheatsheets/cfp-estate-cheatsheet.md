- Grantor controls ultimate beneficiaries
- Common in blended families

| Trust | Income To | Remainder To |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| **CRT** | Donor/heirs | Charity |
| **CLT** | Charity | Donor/heirs |

**Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)**:
- CRAT: Fixed annuity (5-50% of initial value)
