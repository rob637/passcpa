## Time Value of Money (TVM)

### Core Formulas

| Formula | Description | HP Calculator |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| FV = PV × (1 + r)ⁿ | Future Value | N, I/Y, PV → FV |
| PV = FV / (1 + r)ⁿ | Present Value | N, I/Y, FV → PV |
| Rule of 72 | Years to double = 72 ÷ r | Quick estimate |

### Annuity Types
- **Ordinary Annuity**: Payments at END of period (most common)
- **Annuity Due**: Payments at BEGINNING of period
- Annuity Due PV = Ordinary Annuity PV × (1 + r)

### Key Concepts
- **Compounding**: More frequent = higher effective rate
- **EAR**: Effective Annual Rate = (1 + r/n)ⁿ - 1
- **APR**: Annual Percentage Rate (nominal rate)
- **Real Rate**: ≈ Nominal Rate - Inflation Rate

## Financial Statements & Ratios

### Personal Financial Statements

**Balance Sheet** (Statement of Net Worth)
```
Assets - Liabilities = Net Worth
```

**Cash Flow Statement**
```
Income - Expenses = Surplus/Deficit
```

### Key Personal Ratios

| Ratio | Formula | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Emergency Fund | Liquid Assets ÷ Monthly Expenses | 3-6 months |
| Housing (Front-end) | PITI ÷ Gross Income | ≤ 28% |
| Total Debt (Back-end) | All Debt ÷ Gross Income | ≤ 36% |
| Savings Rate | Savings ÷ Gross Income | 10-15%+ |
| Debt-to-Asset | Total Debt ÷ Total Assets | < 50% |
| Net Worth | Assets - Liabilities | Positive & growing |

### Business Financial Statements
- **Income Statement**: Revenue, expenses, profit over period
- **Balance Sheet**: Assets, liabilities, equity at point in time
- **Cash Flow Statement**: Operating, investing, financing activities

## Economics Fundamentals

### Fiscal vs Monetary Policy

| Type | Authority | Tools |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Fiscal Policy | Congress/President | Taxing, spending |
| Monetary Policy | Federal Reserve | Interest rates, money supply |

### Federal Reserve Tools
1. **Open Market Operations**: Buy/sell securities
2. **Discount Rate**: Rate banks borrow from Fed
3. **Reserve Requirements**: Required bank reserves
4. **Federal Funds Rate**: Target interbank lending rate

### Business Cycles
- **Expansion**: Growth, low unemployment, rising prices
- **Peak**: Maximum output, potential inflation
- **Contraction/Recession**: Declining GDP, rising unemployment
- **Trough**: Lowest point before recovery

### Key Economic Indicators

| Indicator | Type | What It Measures |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| GDP | Coincident | Economic output |
| Unemployment | Lagging | Labor market health |
| Stock Market | Leading | Future expectations |
| Consumer Confidence | Leading | Spending intentions |
| CPI | Coincident | Inflation |

## Capital Budgeting

### NPV (Net Present Value)
- NPV > 0: **ACCEPT** (adds value)
- NPV < 0: **REJECT** (destroys value)
- NPV = 0: Indifferent (earns required return exactly)

### IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
- Rate that makes NPV = 0
- IRR > Required Return: **ACCEPT**
- IRR < Required Return: **REJECT**

### Decision Rules Conflict
- When NPV and IRR conflict, **use NPV**
- NPV assumes reinvestment at required rate (more realistic)
- IRR assumes reinvestment at IRR (often unrealistic)

## Behavioral Finance

### Common Biases

| Bias | Description | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Loss Aversion | Losses hurt 2x more than equivalent gains | Hold losers too long |
| Overconfidence | Overestimate abilities | Excessive trading |
| Anchoring | Fixate on initial information | Slow to update views |
| Herding | Following the crowd | Buy high, sell low |
| Confirmation | Seek confirming evidence | Ignore warning signs |
| Recency | Weight recent events heavily | Extrapolate trends |
| Mental Accounting | Treat money differently | Suboptimal decisions |

## Financial Calculator Keys

| N | Number of periods |
| I/YR | Interest rate per year |
| PV | Present value (negative = outflow) |
| PMT | Payment amount |
| FV | Future value |

### Tips
- Clear before each problem (C ALL)
