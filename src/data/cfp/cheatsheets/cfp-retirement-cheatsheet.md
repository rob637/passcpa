## Retirement Income Strategies

### Withdrawal Rate Guidelines
- **4% Rule**: Withdraw 4% initially, adjust for inflation
- Conservative starting point for 30-year retirement
- May need adjustment based on:
  - Longevity expectations
  - Market conditions
  - Spending flexibility

### Account Withdrawal Sequence
**Traditional Approach**:
1. Taxable accounts first
2. Tax-deferred (Traditional IRA, 401k)
3. Tax-free (Roth) last

**Tax-Efficient Approach**:
- Consider filling tax brackets strategically
- Roth conversions in low-income years
- Manage IRMAA thresholds

### Bucket Strategy
- **Bucket 1**: Cash/short-term (1-2 years expenses)
- **Bucket 2**: Bonds/conservative (3-7 years)
- **Bucket 3**: Stocks/growth (8+ years)

### Sequence of Returns Risk
- Poor early returns can devastate retirement portfolio
- Mitigate with:
  - Cash buffer
  - Flexible spending
  - Part-time income
  - Delayed Social Security

---

## Key Formulas

### Retirement Savings Target
```
Annual Need ÷ Withdrawal Rate = Target Savings
Example: $100,000 ÷ 0.04 = $2,500,000
```

### Replacement Ratio
```
Retirement Income Need ÷ Pre-Retirement Income
Generally 70-80% of pre-retirement income
```

### Present Value of Annuity (Retirement Income)
```
PMT × [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]
```
