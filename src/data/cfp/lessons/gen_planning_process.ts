# The 7-Step Financial Planning Process

The CFP Board's Practice Standards establish **seven interconnected steps** that certificants must follow when providing **Financial Planning** (as opposed to Financial Advice, which has fewer requirements).

---

## Why This Process Matters

The financial planning process is **not optional** when you hold yourself out as providing financial planning or present a financial plan. Failure to follow these steps can result in:
- CFP Board disciplinary action
- Professional liability exposure  
- Poor client outcomes

> **Exam Tip**: The CFP exam frequently tests the boundary between when the full 7-step process is required versus when limited Financial Advice is acceptable.

---

## The Seven Steps

### 💡 Memory Aid: **U-I-A-D-P-I-M**
*"Under Intense Analysis, Decisions Propel Implementation Momentum"*

---

## Step 1: Understanding the Client's Personal and Financial Circumstances

This is **data gathering** – both quantitative (numbers) and qualitative (attitudes, values, goals).

### Quantitative Data Includes:
- **Assets**: Bank accounts, investments, real estate, personal property
- **Liabilities**: Mortgages, loans, credit card balances
- **Income**: Salary, bonuses, self-employment, passive income, Social Security
- **Expenses**: Fixed (mortgage, insurance) and variable (dining, entertainment)
- **Insurance policies**: Life, health, disability, property, liability
- **Tax information**: Returns, W-2s, 1099s, K-1s
- **Estate documents**: Wills, trusts, beneficiary designations

### Qualitative Data Includes:
- **Goals and dreams**: Retirement by 60, fund children's education, leave a legacy
- **Values and priorities**: Security vs. lifestyle, philanthropy, family
- **Risk tolerance**: Ability and willingness to accept volatility
- **Time horizons**: When funds will be needed
- **Health status**: Life expectancy considerations, insurance needs
- **Family dynamics**: Dependents, blended families, aging parents

---

## Step 2: Identifying and Selecting Goals

Goals must be translated from vague wishes into actionable targets.

### The SMART Framework
Goals should be:

| Criterion | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **S**pecific | "Save for a vacation home" not "save more money" |
| **M**easurable | "$500,000 purchase price" |
| **A**chievable | Within realistic income/savings capacity |
| **R**elevant | Aligned with client values |
| **T**ime-bound | "Within 5 years" |

### Goal Prioritization
Clients typically cannot fund all goals. Help them prioritize:
1. **Needs**: Emergency fund, adequate insurance, retirement minimum
2. **Wants**: Lifestyle upgrades, vacation home, early retirement
3. **Wishes**: Luxury items, leaving large inheritance

> **Exam Tip**: Questions often present scenarios where clients have conflicting goals. You must identify the priority order.

---

## Step 3: Analyzing the Client's Current Course of Action and Potential Alternatives

This is the **analytical phase** where you determine:
- Can the client achieve their goals with their current behavior?
- What gaps exist between current trajectory and goals?
- What alternative strategies could close those gaps?

### Analysis Techniques:
- **Cash flow projections**: Will savings rate fund goals?
- **Retirement needs analysis**: Using Monte Carlo or deterministic models
- **Insurance gap analysis**: Is coverage adequate?
- **Tax efficiency review**: Are they leaving money on the table?
- **Estate plan review**: Will assets transfer as intended?

### Identifying Alternatives:
For each goal gap, brainstorm options:
- Save more / spend less
- Delay the goal (retire at 67 instead of 62)
- Accept more investment risk for higher expected returns
- Downsize the goal ($400k home instead of $500k)
- Use alternative funding (home equity, inheritance)

---

## Step 4: Developing the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)

Select the **best course of action** for the client from the alternatives analyzed.

### Recommendation Requirements:
- Must be in the client's **best interest** (Fiduciary Duty)
- Must be **suitable** for the client's circumstances
- Must be **consistent** with the client's goals and values
- Must consider **tax implications**
- Must be **realistic** to implement

### Documentation:
The plan should clearly state:
- What is being recommended
- Why it is being recommended
- What the expected outcome is
- What risks or trade-offs exist

---

## Step 5: Presenting the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)

Communicate the plan **clearly and completely** so the client can make informed decisions.

### Presentation Must Include:
- Summary of goals and priorities
- Current status assessment
- Recommended strategies and actions
- Assumptions used (inflation, returns, life expectancy)
- Risks and limitations
- Alternatives considered and why they were rejected

### Best Practices:
- Use visual aids (charts, graphs)
- Avoid jargon; ensure client understanding
- Encourage questions
- Confirm client understanding before proceeding

> **Exam Tip**: The CFP exam tests whether you understand that recommendations must be explained, not just delivered.

---

## Step 6: Implementing the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)

Execute the plan. This step requires clear assignment of **responsibilities**.

### Implementation Questions:
- **Who** is responsible for each action? (Planner, client, attorney, CPA, insurance agent)
- **What** specific actions need to occur?
- **When** must each action be completed?
- **What documentation** is needed?

### Common Implementation Actions:
| Area | Actions |
|------|---------|
| Investments | Open accounts, transfer assets, rebalance portfolio |
| Insurance | Apply for policies, update beneficiaries |
| Retirement | Increase 401(k) contributions, open IRA |
| Estate | Draft will, create trust, fund trust |
| Tax | Adjust withholdings, make estimated payments |

### Fiduciary Responsibility:
If you earn commissions or other compensation from product sales, you must:
- Disclose the compensation
- Confirm the product is still in the client's best interest
- Document why this product was selected

---

## Step 7: Monitoring Progress and Updating

Financial planning is **ongoing**, not a one-time event.

### Scheduled Reviews:
Establish a regular review schedule (annually, semi-annually, or quarterly for complex situations).

### Trigger Events Requiring Review:
- Marriage, divorce, or death
- Birth or adoption of a child
- Job change, promotion, or termination
- Inheritance or windfall
- Major purchase or sale
- Tax law changes
- Market significant movements
- Health changes

### Update Process:
1. Gather updated data
2. Assess progress toward goals
3. Identify new goals or changed circumstances
4. Revise recommendations as needed
5. Document all changes and rationale

---

## When Is the Full Process Required?

The **complete 7-step process** is required when you:
- Hold yourself out as providing "financial planning"
- Prepare and deliver a "financial plan"
- Provide Financial Planning as defined by CFP Board

### Limited-Scope Engagements:
You may provide **Financial Advice** (not full Financial Planning) when:
- The engagement is limited to specific topic(s)
- Scope limitations are clearly disclosed in writing
- Client agrees to the limited scope
- You avoid holding yourself out as providing comprehensive planning

> **Example**: A client asks only about 529 plan options. You can provide advice on that topic without a full financial plan, as long as you document the limited scope.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. The 7 steps are **sequential but iterative** – you may return to earlier steps
2. **Documentation** is critical at every step
3. The process applies to **Financial Planning engagements**, not all client interactions
4. **Monitoring** is ongoing – the plan is never "done"
5. **Fiduciary duty** applies throughout all seven steps

---

## Practice Application

**Scenario**: A couple (ages 45 and 43) comes to you wanting to retire at 65 and fund their two children's college education.

**Step 1**: Gather their financial statements, tax returns, insurance policies, and discuss their values (is early retirement more important than a prestigious college?).

**Step 2**: Identify specific goals: Retire at 65 with 80% income replacement; fund 4 years of state university for each child.

**Step 3**: Run projections – current savings rate funds only 60% of retirement; education is underfunded by $120,000.

**Step 4**: Recommend: Increase savings by $800/month, shift asset allocation, open 529 plans with $500/month contributions.

**Step 5**: Present comprehensive plan with projections showing goal achievement at new savings rate.

**Step 6**: Client opens 529 accounts; increases 401(k) contributions; you rebalance portfolio.

**Step 7**: Schedule annual reviews; flag refinancing opportunity; adjust after job promotion.

# Client Data Gathering - Quantitative Information

**Quantitative data** consists of objective, numerical facts about a client's financial situation. This is the "hard data" needed to perform calculations and build projections.

---

## Why Complete Data Matters

Incomplete data leads to:
- ❌ Incorrect recommendations
- ❌ Inappropriate risk exposure
- ❌ Missed opportunities
- ❌ Liability for the planner

> **Exam Tip**: Questions often present scenarios with missing data. The correct answer is often "gather more information before recommending."

2. Quantitative data is **objective and numerical**
3. Organize data into **standardized statements** (balance sheet, income statement)
4. **Document sources** and dates for all information
5. Watch for **red flags and inconsistencies** that require follow-up

# Client Data Gathering - Qualitative Information

**Qualitative data** is subjective information about a client's values, attitudes, preferences, relationships, and life circumstances. While quantitative data tells you the "what," qualitative data tells you the "why."

---

## Why Qualitative Data Matters

Two clients with identical net worth, income, and age may need **completely different plans** based on:
- Their goals and priorities
- Their comfort with risk
- Their family situations
- Their health expectations
- Their values about money

> **Exam Tip**: Many CFP exam questions test whether you recognize when qualitative factors should change a recommendation.

---

## Categories of Qualitative Data

### 1. Goals and Objectives

These are the **desired outcomes** the client wants to achieve.

#### Types of Goals:
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Short-term** | Within 1 year | Build emergency fund |
| **Intermediate** | 1-10 years | Save for home down payment |
| **Long-term** | 10+ years | Retirement, legacy |

#### Goal Exploration Questions:
- What are you hoping to accomplish with financial planning?
- If you could achieve only one financial goal, what would it be?
- What does financial success look like to you?
- What are you most worried about?

---

### 2. Risk Tolerance

Risk tolerance has **two components**:

| Component | Definition | How to Assess |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Risk Capacity** (Ability) | Financial ability to absorb losses | Time horizon, income stability, net worth |
| **Risk Willingness** (Attitude) | Psychological comfort with volatility | Questionnaires, discussion, past behavior |

#### Key Insight:
**Lower of the two governs**. A client may have high capacity (young, high income, long time horizon) but low willingness (anxiety about losses). Recommendations should respect the lower tolerance.

#### Risk Assessment Questions:
- How did you feel/act during the 2020 or 2022 market downturns?
- What would you do if your portfolio dropped 20% in one month?
- Have you ever sold investments during a market decline?
- How important is stability of principal vs. growth potential?

---

### 3. Time Horizons

Different time horizons for different goals affect:
- Asset allocation appropriate for each goal
- Flexibility in timing
- Risk that can be tolerated

#### Common Time Horizons:
| Goal | Typical Timeline | Asset Allocation Implication |
|------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Emergency Fund | Immediate | 100% liquid, stable |
| Home Purchase | 2-5 years | Conservative, limited equity |
| College Funding | 5-18 years | Glide path from growth to conservative |
| Retirement | 10-40 years | Higher equity allocation |
| Legacy/Estate | Perpetual | Can be aggressive |

---

### 4. Values and Attitudes About Money

These reveal the **emotional relationship** with money.

#### Money Scripts (Dr. Brad Klontz):
| Script | Belief | Behavior |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Money Avoidance** | Money is bad, rich people are greedy | May sabotage success, give away money |
| **Money Worship** | More money solves all problems | Overspending, over-leveraging |
| **Money Status** | Self-worth tied to net worth | Overspending to impress |
| **Money Vigilance** | Money is secret, frugality is paramount | May under-spend, anxiety about finances |

#### Discussion Questions:
- What messages about money did you learn growing up?
- Do you and your spouse/partner agree about money?
- What would you do if you inherited $1 million today?
- What role does money play in your definition of success?

---

### 5. Family Dynamics and Circumstances

Family situation dramatically affects planning priorities.

#### Key Questions:
- Marital status (married, divorced, widowed, single, domestic partner)
- Children (ages, special needs, adopted, stepchildren)
- Aging parents (financial support needed? caregiving?)
- Blended families (prior marriages, support obligations)
- Dependents beyond immediate family
- Family relationships (are children financially responsible?)

#### Special Situations:
| Situation | Planning Impact |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Special needs child | Special needs trust, ABLE account, Medicaid planning |
| Blended family | Beneficiary complexity, prenuptial review |
| Sandwich generation | Dual care obligations, stretched resources |
| Family discord | Careful estate planning, clear communication |

---

### 6. Health Status and Expectations

Health affects:
- Life insurance needs and insurability
- Long-term care planning
- Retirement income duration assumptions
- Estate planning urgency

#### Key Questions:
- Current health status (chronic conditions, medications)
- Family health history (longevity, hereditary conditions)
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, exercise, diet)
- Are you insurable (or have been declined for coverage)?

#### Life Expectancy Considerations:
- Planning software uses actuarial tables but may need adjustment
- Family history of longevity suggests planning for age 95+
- Serious health conditions may suggest accelerated planning

---

### 7. Employment and Career

Beyond income (quantitative), consider:
- Job security and satisfaction
- Career trajectory (promotions, industry outlook)
- Retirement plans and desires
- Employer benefits (pension, stock options, deferred comp)
- Business ownership considerations
- Flexibility for other priorities (family, travel)

---

### 8. Attitudes Toward Planning

How engaged will the client be in the process?

| Attitude | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Delegator** | Wants to hand off; minimal involvement | Provide clear recommendations; scheduled check-ins |
| **Validator** | Has ideas; wants professional confirmation | Listen first, then provide data-driven guidance |
| **Collaborator** | Wants partnership in decision-making | Co-create the plan; explain reasoning |
| **Guardian** | Slow to change, risk-averse | Build trust over time; start with smaller changes |

---

## Qualitative vs. Quantitative Comparison

| Quantitative | Qualitative |
|--------------|-------------|
| $1.2M net worth | Desire for financial security |
| $180,000 salary | Fear of job loss |
| 15 years to retirement | Dream of retiring to travel |
| $12,000/month expenses | Worry about outliving savings |
| 6% portfolio return | Anxiety about market volatility |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Qualitative data is subjective** – values, goals, emotions, relationships
2. **Risk tolerance = capacity + willingness** (lower of two governs)
3. **Family dynamics** significantly impact planning priorities
4. **Money scripts** reveal emotional relationship with wealth
5. **Both quantitative and qualitative data** are needed for sound recommendations

# SMART Goals and Priority Setting

Financial planning succeeds when vague aspirations become **specific, measurable targets** with clear priorities. This lesson covers how to transform client wishes into actionable goals and prioritize when resources are limited.

---

## The SMART Framework

### What Makes a Goal SMART?

| Letter | Meaning | Question to Ask |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **S** | Specific | What exactly do you want to accomplish? |
| **M** | Measurable | How will you know when it's achieved? |
| **A** | Achievable | Is this realistic given your resources? |
| **R** | Relevant | Does this align with your values and priorities? |
| **T** | Time-bound | When do you want to achieve this? |

---

### Transforming Vague Goals to SMART Goals

#### Example 1: Retirement
| Vague | SMART |
|-------|-------|
| "I want to retire comfortably" | "I will retire at age 65 with $80,000/year in today's dollars, adjusted for inflation, for 30 years" |

**Analysis:**
- **S**pecific: Retire at 65 with defined income
- **M**easurable: $80,000/year in today's dollars
- **A**chievable: To be validated by projections
- **R**elevant: Aligns with desire for financial independence
- **T**ime-bound: At age 65 (e.g., in 15 years)

#### Example 2: Education
| Vague | SMART |
|-------|-------|
| "I want to pay for my kids' college" | "Fund 100% of in-state public university costs ($25,000/year × 4 years × 2 children) starting in 10 and 13 years" |

#### Example 3: Major Purchase
| Vague | SMART |
|-------|-------|
| "I want a vacation home someday" | "Purchase a $500,000 vacation home in the mountains within 5 years with 20% down payment" |

---

## Goals vs. Constraints

### Goals (Positive)
What the client wants to achieve:
- Retire at 60
- Fund children's education
- Leave $500,000 to heirs
- Buy a business

### Constraints (Limitations)
Factors that limit how goals can be achieved:
- Must maintain $50,000 emergency fund
- Cannot work past age 62 (health)
- Risk tolerance limits aggressive investing
- Cash flow limited to $2,000/month savings

> **Exam Tip**: Questions often ask whether something is a goal or a constraint. Constraints are boundaries; goals are targets.

---

## Priority Hierarchy: Needs, Wants, Wishes

When resources are insufficient for all goals, prioritize using this hierarchy:

### Level 1: Needs (Survival & Security)
**These must be funded first.**
- Emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)
- Adequate insurance (life, health, disability, liability)
- Minimum retirement savings (avoid poverty in old age)
- Basic estate documents (will, POA)
- Debt management (avoid default)

### Level 2: Wants (Desirable but Not Essential)
**Fund after needs are secure.**
- Comfortable retirement (beyond minimum)
- Children's education
- Home ownership / upgrades
- Lifestyle enhancements
- Early retirement (before 62-67)

### Level 3: Wishes (Aspirational)
**Achievable if Level 1 and 2 are met.**
- Vacation home
- Large inheritance to heirs
- Major philanthropy
- Luxury items / experiences
- Financial independence at 50

---

## Resolving Conflicting Goals

Clients often have goals that **compete for the same resources**. 

### Trade-Off Analysis
Present the trade-offs quantitatively:

> "If you retire at 60 instead of 65, you'll need to save an additional $1,200/month. Alternatively, you could retire at 60 but with 75% of your target income. Which is more important: the retirement date or the income level?"

### Common Trade-Off Scenarios

| Conflict | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Early retirement vs. education funding** | Retire later, or have children take loans |
| **Large home vs. savings rate** | Smaller home, or slower wealth accumulation |
| **Lifestyle now vs. later** | Balance current enjoyment with future security |
| **Charity vs. inheritance** | Discuss legacy priorities with family |

### Decision Framework
1. Revisit values and what matters most
2. Quantify the impact of each choice
3. Consider hybrid solutions (partial funding of both)
4. Document the client's decision and reasoning

## Documenting Goals

### Goal Summary Table

| Goal | Amount | Time Frame | Priority | Monthly Funding |
|------|--------|------------|----------|-----------------|
| Emergency Fund | $30,000 | 12 months | Need | $2,500 |
| Retirement at 65 | $2M | 20 years | Need | $2,000 |
| College - Child 1 | $100,000 | 10 years | Want | $700 |
| College - Child 2 | $100,000 | 13 years | Want | $550 |
| Vacation Home | $500,000 | 7 years | Wish | $3,000 |

### Total Monthly Requirement: $8,750
### Available Monthly Savings: $5,000
### Funding Gap: $3,750/month

**Decision Required**: Client must either increase savings, delay/reduce goals, or accept not achieving all goals.

## Key Takeaways

1. **SMART goals** transform wishes into actionable targets
2. Distinguish **goals (positive targets)** from **constraints (limitations)**
3. Use the **Needs-Wants-Wishes** hierarchy for prioritization
4. **Quantify trade-offs** when goals conflict
5. **Document decisions** including client's reasoning

# Scope of Engagement and Client Agreement

Before beginning work with a client, CFP® professionals must **clearly establish the scope of engagement** and document it in a **written agreement**. This protects both the client and the planner.

---

## Why Scope Definition Matters

A clearly defined scope:
- Sets expectations for both parties
- Defines what IS and IS NOT included
- Protects against liability for areas not covered
- Ensures compliance with CFP Board standards
- Enables appropriate fee disclosure

---

## Types of Engagements

### Comprehensive Financial Planning
Covers **all major areas** of a client's financial life:
- Cash flow and budgeting
- Insurance and risk management
- Investment planning
- Tax planning
- Retirement planning
- Estate planning

**Requires**: Full 7-step process, extensive data gathering, ongoing relationship.

### Limited-Scope (Modular) Engagement
Covers **specific topics only** as agreed with the client.

**Examples**:
- Retirement income analysis only
- Investment portfolio review only
- 529 plan consultation
- Stock option exercise strategy
- Social Security claiming strategy

**Requirements for Limited Scope**:
1. Document the limitation **in writing**
2. Client must **agree** to the limitation
3. Do not provide advice on excluded topics
4. Do not hold yourself out as providing "financial planning" if limited

---

## Required Disclosures

### Information to Provide the Client

At engagement, CFP® professionals must provide:

| Disclosure | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Scope of engagement** | What is included and excluded |
| **How advice will be provided** | Written plan, verbal, ongoing? |
| **Client's responsibilities** | Providing info, making decisions |
| **Conflicts of interest** | Compensation incentives, affiliations |
| **Compensation method** | Fee-only, commission, fee-based, salary |
| **How to terminate** | By either party, what happens to data |
| **CFP® professional's duties** | Fiduciary or other standard |

---

## The Written Engagement Agreement

### Required Elements

A comprehensive engagement letter includes:

**1. Parties**
- Names and contact information
- Entity name if applicable

**2. Scope of Services**
- Services to be provided
- Services explicitly excluded
- Time frame of engagement

**3. Client Responsibilities**
- Providing complete and accurate information
- Notifying planner of changes
- Making final decisions

**4. Compensation**
- Fee amount and structure
- Billing frequency
- What expenses are included/excluded
- Disclosure of any third-party compensation

**5. Conflicts of Interest**
- Affiliations (broker-dealer, insurance agency)

**7. Privacy**

---

## Fiduciary and Suitability Standards

### When Providing Financial Planning:
- **Fiduciary duty applies** (Duty of Loyalty, Care, Follow Instructions)
- Must act in client's **best interest**
- Conflicts must be avoided or disclosed and managed

### When Providing Financial Advice (Non-Planning):
- **Fiduciary duty still applies** at the time advice is given
- But reduced ongoing obligations

### When in Sales Role Only:
- Suitability standard may apply (not best interest)
- Still must disclose CFP® certification
- Still subject to CFP Board disciplinary process

---

## Practice Standards Compliance

The CFP Board's Practice Standards require that:

1. **Scope must be documented** before planning begins
2. **Material conflicts** disclosed before or at engagement
3. **Client must agree** to limited scope if engagement is modular
4. **Comprehensive planning** must use the full 7-step process
5. **Written plan** required for financial planning (not just verbal)

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Define scope clearly** and in writing before beginning work
2. **Comprehensive** covers all areas; **limited-scope** covers specific topics
3. **Document client agreement** including responsibilities of both parties
4. **Disclose compensation** and conflicts of interest
5. **Termination provisions** protect both parties
