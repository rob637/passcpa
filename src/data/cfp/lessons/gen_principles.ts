# The Financial Planning Process

The CFP Board defines a 7-step financial planning process that all certificants must follow when providing financial planning. 

**Mnemonic: U-I-A-D-P-I-M** ("Uber Is A Drunk Person In Motion")

## 1. Understand the Client's Personal and Financial Circumstances
Before any advice is given, you must gather qualitative and quantitative data.
- **Quantitative:** Assets, liabilities, cash flow, taxes, insurance policies.
- **Qualitative:** Goals, values, risk tolerance, health status, family dynamics.

## 2. Identify and Select Goals
- Work with the client to distinguish between needs and wants.
- Make goals SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound).

## 3. Analyze the Client's Current Course of Action and Potential Alternative Courses of Action
- Analyze the data to determine if the client can meet their goals with their current behavior.
- Brainstorm alternatives (e.g., retire later, save more, spend less, take more risk).

## 4. Develop the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)
- Select the best course of action.
- Ensure recommendations are suitable and in the client's best interest (Fiduciary Duty).

## 5. Present the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)
- Communicate the plan clearly.
- Discuss pros, cons, and risks.

## 6. Implement the Financial Planning Recommendation(s)
- Define who is responsible for what (planner vs. client).
- Execute trades, buy insurance, update estate docs.

## 7. Monitor Progress and Updates
- Establish a review schedule.
- Update the plan as life events occur (marriage, birth, death, job change).

### Integration with Practice Standards
Usage of this process is mandatory when providing Financial Planning. It is not required for simple, transaction-only brokerage interactions (though best practice).

### Case Application
> **Scenario:** A client comes to you wanting to buy a vacation home. 
> **Step 1:** You ask about their budget (Quant) and why they want it (Qual).
> **Step 2:** You determine they want to buy it in 5 years for $500k.
> **Step 3:** You analyze their savings; they are only saving $100/mo. Current course fails.
> **Step 4:** You recommend saving $5k/mo or reducing the budget.
