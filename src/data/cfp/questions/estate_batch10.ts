      'D) No modifications allowed',
      'C) Beneficiary verbal agreement',
      'B) A trust amendment for specific changes or a complete trust restatement for comprehensive updates',
      'A) Verbal instructions only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Trust modification: Amendment—specific changes while keeping original intact; good for minor updates. Restatement—replaces entire trust document; better for major changes, avoids confusion from multiple amendments. Both require grantor capacity and proper execution. Restatement often preferred after several amendments for clarity. Irrevocable trusts: different modification rules.'

Should fund trust during life to minimize probate.'
