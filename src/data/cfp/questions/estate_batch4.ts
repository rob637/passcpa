    question: 'For 2026, the federal estate tax exemption is approximately:',
    options: [
      'A) $5 million per person',
      'B) $7 million per person',
      'D) $27 million per married couple',
      'C) $13.6 million per person',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The 2017 TCJA approximately doubled the estate tax exemption, which is indexed for inflation. For 2026, the exemption is approximately $13.6 million per person ($27.2 million for married couples with portability). Note: This amount is scheduled to sunset to approximately $7 million after 2025 unless extended.'

      'A) Married couples to avoid estate tax entirely',
      'B) Unlimited transfers between spouses without gift or estate tax',
      'C) All beneficiaries to receive property tax-free',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The unlimited marital deduction allows unlimited transfers between spouses (U.S. citizens) without incurring gift or estate tax. This defers taxation until the surviving spouse\'s death. For non-citizen spouses, a Qualified Domestic Trust (QDOT) is required to obtain the deduction.'

    question: 'For portability of a deceased spouse\'s unused exemption (DSUE) to be available:',
    options: [
      'D) All assets must pass to the surviving spouse',
      'A) An estate tax return must be filed timely, even if not otherwise required',
      'B) The estate must exceed the exemption amount',
      'C) The surviving spouse must remarry within two years',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'To preserve portability of the deceased spouse\'s unused exemption, the executor must timely file Form 706, even if no estate tax is due. This election allows the surviving spouse to add the deceased spouse\'s unused exemption to their own, potentially doubling exemption protection.'

    question: 'An heir inherits stock worth $500,000 that the decedent purchased for $100,000. If the heir immediately sells the stock, the taxable gain is:',
    options: [
      'A) $400,000',
      'D) $0',
      'B) $100,000',
      'C) $500,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Assets receive a step-up (or step-down) in basis to fair market value at death. The heir\'s basis becomes the $500,000 FMV, not the decedent\'s $100,000 cost basis. Selling immediately at $500,000 results in no capital gain. This step-up is a significant tax benefit of holding appreciated assets until death.'

    options: [
      'D) Providing for incapacity management',
      'B) Maintaining privacy of asset distribution',
      'A) Avoiding probate',
      'C) Reducing estate taxes',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Revocable living trusts avoid probate, maintain privacy (unlike wills which become public), and allow continued asset management during incapacity. However, because the grantor retains control, assets remain in the taxable estate. Revocable trusts provide NO estate tax reduction.'

    question: 'A key characteristic of an irrevocable trust is that:',
    options: [
      'B) Assets transferred are generally removed from the grantor\'s taxable estate',
      'D) The trust becomes revocable after the grantor\'s death',
      'A) The grantor can change beneficiaries at any time',
      'C) The grantor retains full control over trust assets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Irrevocable trusts remove assets from the grantor\'s taxable estate because the grantor gives up control and ownership rights. In exchange for this loss of control, the assets (and future appreciation) are not subject to estate tax in the grantor\'s estate. The grantor cannot change the terms once established.'

      'B) Defer all estate taxes until both spouses die',
      'A) Provide income to the surviving spouse while sheltering assets from their estate',
      'D) Provide immediate distributions to grandchildren',
      'C) Eliminate the need for an estate tax return',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A credit shelter (bypass) trust is funded with assets up to the deceased spouse\'s remaining exemption. The surviving spouse can receive income and even principal for health, education, maintenance, and support, but the assets bypass their estate entirely—passing tax-free to children or other beneficiaries.'

    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'An estate planner recommends a QTIP trust for a client in a second marriage. What is the PRIMARY advantage of a QTIP trust compared to an outright bequest to the surviving spouse?',
    options: [
      'QTIP trusts avoid all estate taxes at both the first and second death',
      'The deceased spouse controls the ultimate disposition of the trust assets, ensuring they pass to chosen remaindermen rather than the surviving spouse\'s heirs',
      'QTIP trusts are exempt from the generation-skipping transfer tax',
      'The surviving spouse has unlimited withdrawal rights over QTIP trust principal',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A QTIP trust qualifies for the marital deduction while allowing the first-to-die spouse to designate who receives the trust assets after the surviving spouse\'s death. This is critical in blended families where the goal is to provide for the surviving spouse while ensuring assets ultimately pass to children from a prior marriage.',

      'B) $38,000',
      'D) $34,000',
      'C) $17,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The annual gift exclusion is $19,000 per recipient for 2025 (indexed for inflation). A married couple can split gifts, giving each recipient $38,000 annually ($19,000 from each spouse) without using lifetime exemption or filing a gift tax return (unless electing gift splitting).'

      'A) Directly to the grandchild',
      'D) To the grandchild\'s parents for reimbursement',
      'C) Directly to the educational institution',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Unlimited payments for tuition or medical expenses are excluded from gift tax if paid directly to the educational institution or medical provider. This is in addition to the annual exclusion. Paying the student or a 529 plan does not qualify for this unlimited exclusion.'

      'B) A present interest gift (Crummey power)',
      'A) Made to a family member',
      'D) Made to someone over age 18',
      'C) Less than $10,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Only present interest gifts qualify for the annual exclusion. Future interests (like remainder interests in trusts) do not qualify. Crummey powers give beneficiaries a limited time to withdraw contributions, converting gifts to trusts into present interests eligible for the annual exclusion.'

      'A) Transfer appreciation above the Section 7520 rate to beneficiaries gift-tax-free',
      'D) Allow the grantor to retain full control of assets',
      'B) Provide income to charities during the grantor\'s life',
      'C) Eliminate all estate taxes on transferred assets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'GRATs transfer appreciation above the IRS Section 7520 interest rate to beneficiaries with minimal or no gift tax. The grantor receives annuity payments for a term of years; any remaining value passes to beneficiaries. If assets outperform the 7520 rate, the excess passes gift-tax-free.'

    options: [
      'A) Has the company purchase a deceased owner\'s interest',
      'D) Uses only term life insurance',
      'B) Has surviving owners personally purchase the deceased\'s interest',
      'C) Requires the estate to purchase new ownership interests',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'In a cross-purchase agreement, surviving owners (not the company) purchase the deceased owner\'s business interest. Each owner owns life insurance on the other owners. This provides a step-up in basis for the surviving owners. With many owners, an entity purchase or trusteed arrangement may be simpler.'

    question: 'Minority and lack of marketability discounts can reduce the gift tax value of transferred business interests because:',
    options: [
      'B) A minority, non-marketable interest is worth less than a proportionate share of total value',
      'D) Discounts only apply to C corporation interests',
      'A) All business interests are automatically discounted',
      'C) The IRS requires discounts on all transfers',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Minority interests lack control over business decisions, and interests in closely-held businesses lack ready markets for sale. These factors make such interests worth less than their proportionate share of total business value. Properly documented discounts (typically 20-40% combined) can significantly reduce gift and estate tax on transfers.'

      'A) When signed by the testator',
      'C) Upon the testator\'s death',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A will is ambulatory—it has no effect until death and can be changed anytime before death. It becomes effective upon the testator\'s death, at which point it is admitted to probate. During life, the testator retains full control over assets and can revoke or amend the will.'

      'B) Continues to be effective if the principal becomes incapacitated',
      'A) Only covers financial matters',
      'C) Cannot be revoked',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A durable power of attorney includes language that it continues in effect (or becomes effective) if the principal becomes incapacitated. A regular POA becomes void upon incapacity. This is essential for managing affairs if someone becomes unable to handle their own decisions.'

      'C) Change the principal\'s will',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A healthcare power of attorney (healthcare proxy) authorizes an agent to make medical decisions when the principal cannot. This is separate from financial powers of attorney. A living will/advance directive may also specify end-of-life treatment preferences.'

      'D) Hold life insurance policies',
      'C) Fund college education expenses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Special needs trusts (supplemental needs trusts) provide for a disabled beneficiary\'s needs beyond what government programs cover without disqualifying them from means-tested benefits like Medicaid and SSI. The trust must be properly structured to avoid being counted as the beneficiary\'s assets.'

      'B) The trust owns the policy and the insured has no incidents of ownership',
      'C) The policy was purchased within three years of death',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'For life insurance to be excluded from the estate, the insured must have no incidents of ownership (ability to change beneficiary, borrow against policy, etc.). The ILIT must own the policy, pay premiums, and the insured should not be trustee. If a policy is transferred to an ILIT, the three-year rule applies.'

      'D) Assets that remain in the donor\'s taxable estate',
      'C) Only tax deductions with no income to the donor',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'CRTs provide income to the donor or other non-charitable beneficiaries for a term or life, with the remainder passing to charity. The donor receives a current income tax deduction for the present value of the charitable remainder. CRTs work well with highly appreciated assets.'

      'D) Only outright gifts, not trusts',
      'B) Transfers to grandchildren or lower generations that skip a generation',
      'C) Transfers between spouses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'GSTT is a separate tax on transfers to skip persons (generally grandchildren or those 37.5+ years younger than the donor). It prevents avoidance of one generation of transfer tax. The GSTT rate is a flat 40%, in addition to any estate or gift tax. Each person has a GSTT exemption equal to the estate exemption.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A married couple wants to use gift splitting. One spouse makes an $80,000 gift to their adult child. If both spouses elect gift splitting and the annual exclusion is $18,000, what is the taxable gift amount?',
    options: [
      '$80,000 because gift splitting does not apply to gifts exceeding $50,000',
      '$44,000 because the gift is split equally and each spouse applies their $18,000 annual exclusion',
      '$62,000 because only one spouse\'s annual exclusion can be applied',
      '$0 because gift splitting eliminates all gift tax on transfers between family members',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'With gift splitting, the $80,000 gift is treated as if each spouse gave $40,000. Each spouse applies their $18,000 annual exclusion, reducing the taxable portion to $22,000 each, or $44,000 total. Gift splitting requires both spouses to consent and file a gift tax return.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Unlike income tax charitable deductions, the estate tax charitable deduction is unlimited. Assets passing to qualified charities at death are fully deductible, reducing the taxable estate dollar-for-dollar. This makes charitable bequests a powerful estate tax planning tool.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,

      'A) All estates must pay taxes within 30 days',
      'C) Probate courts require cash deposits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Estates often contain illiquid assets (real estate, business interests) but face liquidity needs for taxes, administration costs, and family support. Without planning (life insurance, installment payments under §6166), heirs may be forced to sell illiquid assets quickly at discounted prices.'
