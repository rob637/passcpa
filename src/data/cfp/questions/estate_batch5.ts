    question: 'The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT) is designed to:',
    options: [
      'D) Eliminate all estate taxes for grandchildren',
      'A) Reduce estate taxes for all generations',
      'C) Encourage gifts to grandchildren',
      'B) Prevent families from avoiding estate taxes by skipping generations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'GSTT is an additional tax (at the highest estate tax rate) on transfers to "skip persons" (typically grandchildren or those 37.5+ years younger). It prevents avoiding one layer of estate tax by skipping the children\'s generation. Each person has a GST exemption equal to the basic exclusion amount.'

    subtopic: 'Alternate Valuation',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'An estate owns commercial real estate valued at $3 million at the date of death. At the alternate valuation date (6 months later), the property is worth $2.5 million. However, the property was sold to a third party 4 months after death for $2.7 million. At what value should this property be included in the gross estate if the alternate valuation date is elected?',
    options: [
      '$3 million — the date of death value',
      '$2.5 million — the alternate valuation date value',
      '$2.7 million — the value at the date of sale or distribution',
      '$2.85 million — the average of date of death and six-month values',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'When the alternate valuation date is elected, assets sold, distributed, or otherwise disposed of within six months are valued at the date of sale/distribution, not the six-month date. Since the property was sold at month 4 for $2.7 million, that is the value included in the gross estate.',

      'A) Valuation of any real estate at a discount',
      'C) Complete exclusion of farm property from the estate',
      'D) Unlimited valuation discounts',
      'B) Valuation of qualified family farms and closely held businesses based on actual use rather than highest and best use',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Special use valuation allows qualifying real property used in farming or closely held businesses to be valued at current use (e.g., farmland value) rather than highest and best use (e.g., development value). Requirements include material participation and continued use. The reduction is capped (about $1.39M in 2026).'

      'C) The grantor to revoke the trust',
      'A) The trustee to make discretionary distributions',
      'D) Unlimited annual gift tax exclusions',
      'B) Beneficiaries a temporary right to withdraw contributions, qualifying them as present interests for gift tax exclusion',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Crummey powers give beneficiaries a temporary right (typically 30-60 days) to withdraw contributions. This converts gifts to the trust into present interests, qualifying for the annual exclusion. Proper notification procedures are critical. Powers typically lapse if not exercised.'

      'D) Allowing unlimited residence value transfers',
      'B) Transferring a residence at a discounted gift tax value while allowing the grantor to live there for a term of years',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'QPRTs transfer a residence to beneficiaries with the grantor retaining the right to live there for a specified term. The gift value is discounted based on the retained interest. If the grantor survives the term, the residence is excluded from their estate. Risk: dying during the term returns the full value to the estate.'

      'A) The grantor to access trust assets directly',
      'B) Removal of assets from the grantor\'s estate while providing indirect access through distributions to a spouse beneficiary',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'SLATs are irrevocable trusts where one spouse gifts assets (using gift/estate exemption) and the other spouse can receive distributions. This removes assets from the grantor\'s estate while maintaining indirect family access through the beneficiary spouse. Reciprocal trust doctrine must be avoided.'

      'A) The donor pays all gift taxes',
      'B) The donee agrees to pay any gift tax, reducing the taxable gift amount',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A net gift requires the donee to pay any resulting gift tax. This reduces the taxable gift (since the donor\'s obligation is reduced by the tax payment). It can be effective for large transfers when the donor wants to minimize out-of-pocket gift tax. The calculation is circular and requires solving for the net gift value.'

      'Form 706, United States Estate Tax Return',
      'Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Form 709 must be filed by both spouses (or at least the donor spouse with the other spouse\'s consent) to elect gift splitting under IRC Section 2513. The return must be filed even if no taxable gift results after applying the annual exclusion and split-gift election.',

      'A) The gift is made to a trust',
      'C) The gift exceeds the annual exclusion',
      'B) The donor retains certain powers over the transferred property',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A gift is incomplete when the donor retains the power to revoke, change beneficiaries, or control enjoyment. Incomplete gifts are not taxable gift events until the power terminates. Intentionally incomplete gift strategies (ING/NING trusts) may provide state income tax benefits in certain situations.'

      'A) Complete exclusion of business assets from the estate',
      'D) Eliminating the need for succession planning',
      'C) Avoiding all income taxes on business operations',
      'B) Valuation discounts for lack of marketability and minority interest when transferring limited partnership interests',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'FLPs allow transfers of limited partnership interests at discounted values (typically 20-40% combined discount) due to lack of marketability and lack of control. The general partner maintains control while reducing the taxable transfer value. Proper structure and legitimate business purpose are critical to IRS scrutiny.'

      'D) Transfer businesses gift-tax-free',
      'A) Avoid all estate taxes on business interests',
      'C) Sell business interests without capital gains tax',
      'B) Defer payment of estate taxes attributable to closely held businesses over up to 14 years with favorable interest rates',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Section 6166 allows deferral of estate taxes attributable to closely held businesses exceeding 35% of the adjusted gross estate. Payments can be deferred for 5 years (interest only), then paid over 10 years at reduced interest rates. This provides liquidity relief for estates with illiquid business interests.'

      'C) Complete gift tax exclusion',
      'A) Immediate income tax deduction',
      'D) Elimination of all death taxes',
      'B) Estate freeze by transferring appreciation potential while grantor pays income taxes on trust income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Installment sales to IDGTs freeze the estate value (at sale price plus AFR interest) while future appreciation occurs outside the estate. The grantor pays income tax on trust earnings without additional gift consequences, effectively making tax-free gifts. Requires careful structuring with adequate consideration.'

      'C) Avoids all probate',
      'D) Is only valid in community property states',
      'B) Transfers probate assets to an existing trust',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A pour-over will transfers any assets that were not titled in the trust during life into the trust at death. While these assets go through probate (unlike properly funded trust assets), they ultimately distribute according to trust terms. It serves as a safety net for assets not transferred to the trust.'

      'C) Automatic organ donation',
      'D) Early inheritance distribution',
      'B) An appointed agent to make medical decisions if the principal becomes incapacitated',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A healthcare proxy designates someone to make medical decisions when the principal cannot. Unlike a living will (which states preferences), the proxy agent has flexibility to respond to actual circumstances. It\'s essential for medical emergencies and differs from a financial power of attorney.'

      'D) Is only needed for hospital stays',
      'A) Is included automatically in all powers of attorney',
      'B) Allows designated individuals to access protected health information',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'HIPAA authorization grants permission to access protected health information. Without it, family members and agents may be denied medical information even with a healthcare proxy. It\'s often included in healthcare documents or as a separate authorization. Both spouses should have authorizations naming each other and backup agents.'

      'C) Cannot make distributions to grandchildren',
      'A) Is subject to maximum GST tax on all distributions',
      'B) Is exempt from GST tax because GST exemption has been allocated',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'An inclusion ratio of zero means GST exemption has been fully allocated to the trust, making it entirely GST exempt. Distributions and terminations to skip persons incur no GST tax. Careful allocation of GST exemption is essential for dynasty trusts and generation-skipping planning.'

      'B) Some states have lower exemptions than federal and may tax estates that owe no federal tax',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'About a dozen states have estate or inheritance taxes with exemptions often much lower than federal ($1M-$6M vs. $7.0M federal after TCJA sunset). State-level planning may include credit shelter trusts specifically for state exemption amounts, domicile planning, or qualification for state-specific exclusions.'

      'B) A trustee to distribute assets from one trust into another trust with different terms',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Decanting allows trustees in states with decanting statutes to "pour" assets from one irrevocable trust into another with modified terms. Uses include fixing drafting errors, changing situs, updating for tax law changes, or adding flexibility. State law and trust terms govern what changes are permissible.'

      'A) The charity receives the remainder interest in a CLT',
      'D) CLTs have no minimum payout requirements',
      'C) CLTs cannot hold appreciated assets',
      'B) The charity receives current income in a CLT, with remainder passing to non-charitable beneficiaries',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'CLTs provide income to charity for a term, then remainder passes to family or other beneficiaries. CRTs are the opposite—income to individuals, remainder to charity. CLTs are effective when interest rates are low (lower remainder value = lower gift), and can \"zero out\" the gift if structured properly.'

      'B) May allow a grantor to be a discretionary beneficiary while providing creditor protection in certain states',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'About 20 states permit DAPTs where the grantor can be a discretionary beneficiary while achieving some creditor protection. Protection levels, waiting periods, and requirements vary by state. DAPTs are not absolute protection—fraudulent transfer laws, federal claims, and divorce may penetrate the trust.'

      'C) Zero',
      'B) Fair market value at date of death (stepped-up or stepped-down basis)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Inherited property receives a stepped-up (or down) basis to fair market value at death. This eliminates built-in capital gains, a significant tax benefit. Some strategies involve holding appreciated assets until death rather than gifting (which carries over the donor\'s basis). Community property may receive double step-up.'

      'D) The IRS prohibits all family gifts',
      'B) The assignment of income doctrine attributes income to whoever earned it or owns the income-producing property',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The assignment of income doctrine prevents taxpayers from avoiding income tax by directing income to others. Income is taxed to the earner (for services) or property owner (for property income). Simply assigning the right to receive income doesn\'t shift the tax burden. The income-producing property itself must be transferred.'

      'A) There are many shareholders',
      'B) A stepped-up basis for surviving owners is important',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Cross-purchase agreements (owners buy from deceased\'s estate) provide surviving owners with a basis equal to the purchase price. Entity purchases (company buys) don\'t increase survivor\'s basis. With many owners, cross-purchase requires many policies. Trusteed arrangements can simplify multi-party cross-purchases.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Trusts only control assets properly funded into them. New purchases (real estate, bank accounts, investments) may default to individual ownership. Regular reviews ensure new assets are titled correctly. Major life events (inheritance, home purchase) particularly warrant funding reviews.'
