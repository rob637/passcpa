    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'A certificate of trust (certification of trust) is used to:',
    options: [
      'C) Register the trust with the state',
      'B) Provide third parties with key trust information without disclosing the full trust document',
      'A) Replace the trust document entirely',
      'D) Avoid all estate taxes',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A certificate of trust (or trust certification/abstract) summarizes key information (existence, trustees, powers) allowing third parties like banks to deal with the trust without seeing private details like beneficiaries or asset distributions. It protects privacy while facilitating transactions.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A trust restatement differs from a trust amendment in that:',
    options: [
      'A) They are identical',
      'B) A restatement replaces the entire trust document while maintaining the original trust, whereas amendments add to or modify specific provisions',
      'C) Restatements terminate the trust',
      'D) Amendments require court approval'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Amendments change specific provisions while keeping the original document. After multiple amendments, the trust becomes hard to read. A restatement replaces the entire document with a current, consolidated version while the original trust continues—no re-funding needed. Both require the settlor\'s capacity.'

      'A) Notarization in all states',
      'C) Attorney preparation required',
      'D) Court approval before death',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Valid wills generally require: testamentary capacity (understanding nature of assets, beneficiaries, and the act), testamentary intent, written form, signature, and witnesses (typically two). Requirements vary by state—some recognize holographic (handwritten) wills with fewer formalities.'

    options: [
      'C) Beneficiaries to direct all decisions',
      'A) Only court-directed distributions',
      'B) Separation of trustee responsibilities, with an investment advisor directing investments and a distribution committee making distribution decisions',
      'D) Automatic distributions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Directed trusts bifurcate traditional trustee duties. An investment director handles investments; a distribution committee (or advisor) decides discretionary distributions; an administrative trustee handles custody and tax filings. This allows expertise in each area and may provide liability protection in states with directed trust statutes.'

      'C) Federal estate tax only',
      'B) State income tax, trust duration rules, asset protection features, and applicable trust law',
      'D) Investment options',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Trust situs determines governing law. Some states have favorable trust features: no state income tax (Nevada, South Dakota, Delaware), abolished perpetuities rules (allowing dynasty trusts), strong asset protection (spendthrift provisions), and modern trust statutes. Trusts can be moved to more favorable jurisdictions.'

      'D) Converting to revocable trust',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Decanting allows modification of "irrevocable" trusts by pouring assets into a new trust. Available in many states, it can fix drafting problems, adjust distribution standards, add beneficiaries (in some states), or move situs. Typically requires discretionary distribution authority and no material adverse impact on beneficiaries.'

    question: 'An executor is considering electing the alternate valuation date for an estate with assets worth $8 million at date of death and $7.2 million six months later. Under what condition is this election permitted?',
    options: [
      'The election is always available regardless of the effect on estate value',
      'The election is only available if it reduces both the gross estate value and the estate tax liability',
      'The election requires approval from all beneficiaries named in the will',
      'The election is only available for taxable estates exceeding $12 million',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC Section 2032 permits the alternate valuation date election only if it results in a decrease in both the value of the gross estate AND the amount of estate tax. The election cannot be used solely to increase the basis of inherited assets for income tax purposes.',

      'A) Tax-free estate transfers',
      'D) Paying tax with business stock',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Section 6166 helps estates with illiquid business interests. If the business exceeds 35% of adjusted gross estate, estate tax attributable to it can be paid in installments: interest-only for 4 years, then principal plus interest over 10 years. Provides liquidity relief for family businesses.'

    options: [
      'B) The donee agreeing to pay any gift tax due, reducing the gift\'s value for gift tax purposes',
      'C) Only cash gifts',
      'A) Giving after taxes',
      'D) Employer gifts',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Net gifts: the recipient pays the gift tax. This reduces the gift\'s value (it\'s worth less if one must pay tax on it). Circular calculation: gift value minus recipient\'s tax obligation. Useful for large gifts when donor lacks cash for tax. The recipient\'s tax payment isn\'t income to the donor if it doesn\'t exceed gift tax.'

    topic: 'Gifting',
    subtopic: 'Gift of Future Interest',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Gifts of future interests (such as remainder interests in trusts):',
    options: [
      'B) Do not qualify for the annual exclusion because the beneficiary cannot immediately use the gift',
      'A) Qualify for the annual exclusion',
      'C) Are not subject to gift tax',
      'D) Are valued at zero',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The annual exclusion requires a present interest—immediate right to use, possess, or enjoy. Future interests (remainder after a life estate, distributions at trustee discretion) don\'t qualify. Crummey powers convert future interests to present interests by giving withdrawal rights, enabling exclusion use.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'A gift is incomplete for gift tax purposes when:',
    options: [
      'B) The gift exceeds the annual exclusion',
      'A) The donor retains too much control, such as the power to revoke or redirect the gift',
      'C) No gift tax return is filed',
      'D) The donee is a minor',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Complete gifts require the donor to relinquish dominion and control. Retained powers—to revoke, change beneficiaries, or control enjoyment—make gifts incomplete. The transfer isn\'t taxable until complete. Incomplete gift trusts use this strategically, sometimes combined with state tax planning.'

    id: 'cfp-est-b7-013',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-EST',

    options: [
      'A) Direct inheritance only',
      'B) UTMA/UGMA custodianships, trusts (with specific terms for distribution ages), and guardian nominations',
      'C) Delaying all planning until they\'re adults',
      'D) Life insurance beneficiary only'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Minors cannot manage significant assets directly. Options: UTMA/UGMA (simple, terminates at 18-21), trusts (flexible, can extend past majority with staged distributions), guardianship nominations (for care of child), and proper beneficiary designations avoiding direct minor inheritance which requires court supervision.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Which of the following is a key eligibility requirement for opening an ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) account?',
    options: [
      'The beneficiary must have a disability that occurred before age 26',
      'The beneficiary must have annual income below the federal poverty level',
      'The account must be established before the beneficiary reaches age 18',
      'The beneficiary must be receiving Social Security retirement benefits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'ABLE accounts require that the beneficiary\'s qualifying disability must have occurred before age 26. Recent legislation (ABLE Age Adjustment Act) increased this to age 46 starting in 2026. The accounts allow tax-advantaged savings without affecting means-tested benefits like SSI and Medicaid.',

    options: [
      'C) All property must be liquidated',
      'A) Non-citizens cannot inherit',
      'B) The unlimited marital deduction is not available for transfers to non-citizen spouses; a QDOT may be needed',
      'D) There are no differences',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The unlimited marital deduction doesn\'t apply to non-citizen spouses (concern about assets leaving U.S. tax jurisdiction). A QDOT (Qualified Domestic Trust) allows deferral—assets pass to QDOT, with tax on corpus distributions during life. Annual gift exclusion is also higher for non-citizen spouses ($185,000 in 2024).'

      'A) Trust investments',
      'D) Trust duration',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Silent trust (or quiet trust) provisions delay or limit beneficiary notice. Parents may want children to develop independently without expecting inheritance. Most states allow some limitation on information, but core duties (account regularly, respond to reasonable requests) often cannot be fully eliminated.'

      'A) Selling the home immediately',
      'D) Converting to rental property',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'QPRT: grantor gifts home to irrevocable trust but retains residence rights for a term. Gift value is discounted (present value of remainder interest). If grantor outlives the term, home transfers estate-tax-free. If not, home returns to estate (no harm, but no benefit). Lower interest rates increase QPRT benefits.'

      'C) Charitable giving',
      'D) Generation-skipping transfers',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Reverse gift: give low-basis assets to elderly family member; at their death, you inherit with stepped-up basis. However, IRC 1014(e) prevents this if property is acquired within one year of death and passes back to the original donor or spouse. Strategy requires the relative to survive at least one year.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Digital assets include: financial accounts, cryptocurrency, email, social media, cloud storage, domain names, loyalty points. Planning includes: inventory, secure password storage, terms of service review, state digital access laws, and naming someone with authority to access. The Revised Uniform Fiduciary Access to Digital Assets Act (RUFADAA) governs in most states.'

      'C) Be handled by the hospital',
      'D) Never be documented'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Wills are often not read until after funeral arrangements are made. Burial/cremation wishes should be communicated to family directly, in a separate letter, or designated on a specific form. Some states have designated agent statutes. Pre-planning with funeral homes documents and funds these wishes.'

      'A) A complex irrevocable trust',
      'C) A testamentary trust',
      'D) Only for retirement accounts',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Totten trusts are simple "in trust for" or POD bank accounts. The owner maintains full control during life; at death, funds transfer to the beneficiary outside probate. Easy to establish, but provide no ongoing management—the beneficiary receives outright. Named for the case that validated them.'

      'D) Pay for funeral expenses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Graegin loans (from the case name): estate borrows from family entity to pay estate tax/expenses. The interest is an administrative expense deduction. Loans must have legitimate terms—fixed rate, no prepayment—per the case. Useful when estate is illiquid but has ownership in cash-generating entities.'

      'D) Is prohibited',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Selling property below FMV to family creates a gift of the difference. For income tax, basis is allocated between sale and gift portions. Example: $100K property (basis $40K) sold for $60K = $40K sale, $60K gift. Sale portion recognizes gain; gift portion transfers with carryover basis. Both gift and income tax consequences apply.'

      'D) Healthcare decisions cannot be made',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Without POA and healthcare directives, court intervention may be needed. Guardianship (for person) and conservatorship (for finances) are expensive, public proceedings. The court supervises decisions, requiring reports and approvals. Proper planning with durable POA and healthcare proxy avoids this, maintaining privacy and flexibility.'
