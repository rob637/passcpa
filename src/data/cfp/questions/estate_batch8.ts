    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'A living will differs from a healthcare proxy (healthcare power of attorney) in that:',
    options: [
      'B) A living will states specific end-of-life wishes while a healthcare proxy designates a person to make medical decisions',
      'D) Healthcare proxies express wishes',
      'A) They are the same document',
      'C) Living wills appoint agents',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Living will: written declaration of wishes about life-sustaining treatment in terminal conditions (specific instructions—no ventilator, no artificial nutrition). Healthcare proxy/POA: names an agent to make medical decisions when you cannot. Best practice: have both—proxy backed by living will guidance. Without proxy, living will provides direction but no decision-maker.'

      'A) Replace a will entirely',
      'C) Revoke all prior documents',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Codicil: formal amendment to existing will. Must meet same formality requirements (witnessed, signed). Used for minor changes (updating executor, changing specific bequest). Multiple codicils become confusing—if significant changes needed, execute new will. Modern practice often favors new wills over codicils because drafting costs have decreased.'

      'D) Federal recognition',
      'C) Unlimited funding without transfer tax',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'DAPTs: about 20 states allow trusts where the grantor is a beneficiary yet assets have some creditor protection.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Incentive trusts tie distributions to behavior: matching earned income, staying employed, graduating college, maintaining sobriety, performing community service. Concerns: may be too rigid, difficult to administer fairly, can inhibit entrepreneurship or caregiving, conditions deemed unreasonable may be unenforceable. Needs trustee discretion for flexibility.'

      'C) Requires court approval',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Installment sale to IDGT: sell appreciated asset to grantor trust for installment note. No gain on sale (grantor trust = you\'re selling to yourself for income tax). Interest paid comes back to grantor. Asset growth transfers tax-free. Estate frozen at note value. Complex—requires seed gift, reasonable interest rate, and proper structuring.'

      'C) Provides guaranteed payments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Private annuity: transfer property for unsecured lifetime payments from buyer (often family member). Was used to spread gain and remove appreciation. 2006 IRS regulations eliminated tax deferral benefits. Risks: buyer default (no security), seller outlives expectancy, buyer\'s other creditors. Largely replaced by SCINs and installment sales to GRATs/IDGTs.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A self-canceling installment note (SCIN) differs from a standard installment note because:',
    options: [
      'B) It cancels at seller\'s death (no remaining payments owed), but requires a risk premium—higher interest or purchase price',
      'D) It\'s for business use only',
      'A) It cannot be canceled',
      'C) Buyer benefits at death',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'SCIN: installment note that terminates at seller\'s death—remaining balance is canceled, not owed. Advantage: if seller dies during note term, nothing enters estate. Cost: must have risk premium (higher interest or payment). If seller outlives note, no estate benefit. Works best when seller has reduced life expectancy (but actuarial tables used).'

      'B) A deceased beneficiary\'s share passes to their descendants rather than being redistributed to other beneficiaries',
      'A) Equal division among all descendants',
      'C) Only named persons receive benefits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Per stirpes ("by roots"): if beneficiary predeceases, their share goes to their descendants. Example: leave to 3 children per stirpes—if one dies, their children split that 1/3. Per capita: deceased beneficiary\'s share goes to other living beneficiaries. "Per capita at each generation" divides at each level. Specify desired outcome clearly in designations.'

      'B) Marriage, divorce, birth of children, death of beneficiary, or any significant life event affecting intended disposition',
      'A) Only at retirement',
      'C) Never once set',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Review beneficiary designations after: marriage/divorce (ex may still be named), new child/grandchild, beneficiary death, moving to new state (community property implications), estate plan changes, income/asset changes affecting strategy. Annual reviews are best practice. Outdated designations are common and cause unintended results.'

      'B) Maximizes the gift value since neither estate nor charity pays income tax on the distribution',
      'A) Creates taxable income',
      'D) Requires IRS approval',
      'C) Reduces estate tax deduction',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'IRA/401(k) to charity: IRD (income in respect of decedent) normally taxable to beneficiaries isn\'t taxed when paid to tax-exempt charity. Estate gets charitable deduction. Leaves "tax-free" assets (Roth, step-up property) to family initially. Charity may be contingent beneficiary if family disclaims. Efficient way to fulfill charitable goals.'

    explanation: 'Portability: surviving spouse can use deceased spouse\'s unused exemption (DSUE). Must file estate tax return within 9 months (or with extension) electing portability—even if no tax due. Only last deceased spouse\'s DSUE available. Simpler than credit shelter trust but doesn\'t protect growth or multiple remarriages. Often used with trusts together.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'An estate consists primarily of a closely held business valued at $5 million, with limited liquid assets. Which benefit does IRC Section 6166 provide to the executor?',
    options: [
      'Complete exemption from estate tax for closely held business interests',
      'Deferral of estate tax payments attributable to the business interest over up to 14 years, with interest-only payments for the first 4 years',
      'Authority to sell the business interest tax-free to pay estate taxes',
      'Permission to discount the business value by 40% for estate tax purposes',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC Section 6166 allows estates with closely held business interests exceeding 35% of the adjusted gross estate to defer the estate tax attributable to the business over up to 14 years (4 years interest-only, then 10 years of principal and interest). This prevents forced liquidation of family businesses.',

    options: [
      'A) Only federal planning matters',
      'D) Ignore state tax',
      'B) "Credit shelter" trusts must be carefully structured to avoid inadvertently triggering state tax while sheltering federal exemption',
      'C) State tax is deductible',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'With federal exemption at ~$13M but state exemptions often $1-6M, funding a credit shelter trust at federal exemption could trigger unnecessary state tax. Solutions: formula clauses, disclaimer funding, state-only QTIP trusts, portability for federal + trust for state. Must coordinate federal and state planning—what\'s optimal for one may be poor for another.'

      'B) Authority to modify the trust, change trustees, or adapt to changing laws without court involvement',
      'C) Managing investments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Trust protector: third party with powers beyond trustee, often including: removing/replacing trustees, modifying terms for tax law changes, changing situs, converting to grantor trust, adjusting distributions.

      'A) Limits trust investments',
      'C) Reduces trustee fees',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Spendthrift clause: beneficiary cannot voluntarily transfer interest, and creditors cannot reach trust assets before distribution. Once distributed to beneficiary, protection ends. Exceptions may exist: child support, alimony, IRS claims, self-settled trusts. Standard in most trusts. Doesn\'t protect against beneficiary\'s own actions with distributed funds.'

      'A) Eliminates gift tax',
      'C) Always creates income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Net gift: donee agrees to pay gift tax. Gift value is property FMV minus tax. If tax paid exceeds donor\'s basis in property, donor recognizes gain (Diedrich v. Commissioner). Strategy: reduces gift value (net of tax), useful when donor is cash-poor. Complex calculation—tax on net gift requires iterative calculation since tax depends on net value.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'TOD (securities, real estate in some states) and POD (bank accounts) transfer directly to named beneficiaries at death—no probate. Advantage: simplicity, speed. Risk: may not reflect current wishes if not updated, doesn\'t provide control (lump sum to beneficiary), may contradict will or trust planning. Must be coordinated with overall plan.'

      'A) Gifts may be recaptured at death',
      'C) All lifetime gifts are taxable at death',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Anti-clawback rules (final regs 2019): if you use the higher exemption (through 2025) for lifetime gifts, and exemption is lower at death, you won\'t be penalized. Example: gift using $12M exemption, die with $6M exemption—estate tax calculation uses higher of exemption used or available. Creates "use it or lose it" planning opportunity before sunset.'

      'C) Eliminates all litigation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'No-contest clause: beneficiary who challenges the document risks losing their bequest. Effectiveness varies by state—some enforce strictly, others allow challenges with "probable cause." Most effective when challenger has significant bequest at risk. May deter frivolous challenges but doesn\'t eliminate legitimate ones. One of many tools to reduce litigation.'

    explanation: 'Directed trusts: split fiduciary duties. Investment direction trust: family advisor directs investments, trust company handles administration.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: '529 superfunding: elect to treat gift as made over 5 years. 5 × $18K = $90K per donor ($180K married). File gift return electing 5-year treatment. If donor dies within 5 years, pro-rata portion returns to estate. Removes growth from estate immediately. Additional gifts to same beneficiary during 5 years use exemption.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Simultaneous death: if order of death can\'t be determined, Uniform Simultaneous Death Act typically treats owner as surviving beneficiary. Assets pass to contingent beneficiary (if named) or estate (if not). Some designation forms allow specifying survival period (survive by 30 days).

Estate of Strangi cases provide guidance.'
