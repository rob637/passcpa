      'C) Allows higher contribution deductions',
      'B) Offers more control but requires more administration, annual distributions, and public disclosure',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Private foundation vs. DAF: Foundation offers more control (choose investments, hire family, set grant policies) but: 5% annual distribution required, Form 990-PF public, excise tax on net investment income, lower deduction limits (30% vs 60% for cash), higher administrative costs. DAFs simpler but less control. Foundation for larger amounts, family involvement.'

      'A) Property goes to the state',
      'D) Court decides distribution',
      'B) Each is treated as predeceasing the other for their own estate, so property goes to contingent beneficiaries',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Simultaneous death: if impossible to determine who died first, each treated as surviving the other for purposes of their own estate. Result: assets go to contingent beneficiaries, not to primary beneficiary\'s estate. Many states require 120-hour survival requirement. Wills/trusts should address with specific survival clauses. Prevents double estate taxation.'

    explanation: 'State estate/inheritance taxes: ~12 states plus DC have estate tax, often with lower exemptions than federal ($1-6M vs. $13M federal). ~6 states have inheritance tax (rate depends on beneficiary relationship). Some have both. Can\'t assume federal planning is sufficient. State of residence and property location both matter. May affect domicile decisions.'

      'The trust avoids income tax on all investment earnings',
      'Trust assets can grow and pass through multiple generations without incurring additional estate or generation-skipping transfer taxes',
      'The trust can deduct all distributions to beneficiaries as capital losses',
      'Contributions to the trust receive a current income tax deduction',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A dynasty trust can last indefinitely in states without a Rule Against Perpetuities, allowing assets to compound and pass through multiple generations without additional estate or GST taxes. The initial GST exemption allocation shelters growth from generation-skipping taxes in perpetuity.',

      'SLAT assets cannot be invested in marketable securities',
      'The trust must distribute all income annually to the beneficiary spouse',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A major risk of a SLAT is that the grantor\'s access depends on remaining married to the beneficiary spouse. In the event of divorce, the grantor loses indirect access to the trust assets, which have been irrevocably transferred. This makes divorce risk a critical consideration in SLAT planning.',
