    question: "While establishing and defining the client-planner relationship, a CFP® professional must provide certain information to the client. Which of the following is NOT required to be provided in writing specifically at this stage for financial planning engagements?",
    options: [
      "D) Compensation methodology (fee-only, commission, etc.)",
      "A) Privacy Policy",
      "B) Terms of the engagement (scope and limitations)",
      "C) Specific investment recommendations",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "**Correct Answer: C.** Specific investment recommendations are developed *after* data gathering and analysis. At the initial stage of establishing the relationship (Step 1 of the Financial Planning Process), the professional must disclose the scope of services, conflicts of interest, compensation methods, and privacy policies. Recommendations come in Step 4.\n\n**Incorrect Options:**\n* **A, B, D:** These are foundational disclosures required by the Code of Ethics and Standards of Conduct when entering into a financial planning engagement."

    question: "A client, Sarah (35), wants to save for a down payment on a home in 3 years. She has $40,000 currently invested in a high-growth tech stock ETF. She can save an additional $500/month. What is the most appropriate recommendation regarding her $40,000 existing nest egg given her goal?",
    options: [
      "A) Leave it in the tech ETF to maximize growth potential over the 3-year horizon.",
      "D) Buy 3-year LEAP call options on the S&P 500 to leverage the capital.",
      "B) Move the funds to a Diversified Emerging Markets fund to capture higher alpha.",
      "C) Reallocate to a conservative mix of short-term bonds and high-yield cash equivalents.",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "**Correct Answer: C.** For a short-term goal (3 years), capital preservation and liquidity are paramount. The high volatility of a tech ETF is unsuitable because a market downturn could occur just when funds are needed, with insufficient time to recover. \n\n**Incorrect Options:**\n* **A & B:** Equity assessments are too volatile for a 3-year defined liability.\n* **D:** Options are speculative and inappropriate for a primary down payment savings goal."

      "B) 5.14%",
      "A) 5.30%",
      "C) 5.10%",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "**Correct Answer: B (5.14%).** The formula for the real rate of return is `((1 + Nominal) / (1 + Inflation)) - 1`.\n\nCalculation:\n((1.085) / (1.032)) - 1 = 1.051356... - 1 = 0.051356 = 5.14%.\n\n**Common Mistake:** Simply subtracting (8.5% - 3.2% = 5.3%) is an approximation but is mathematically incorrect for precise financial planning."

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: "**Financial Ratio Calculations:**\n\n**Debt-to-Asset Ratio:**\nTotal Liabilities / Total Assets = $320,000 / $800,000 = **40%**\n\n**Net Worth:**\nTotal Assets - Total Liabilities = $800,000 - $320,000 = **$480,000**\n\nA 40% debt ratio is moderate—meaning 60% of assets are owned free and clear. Generally, debt ratios below 50% indicate reasonable financial health, though context matters (age, asset types, interest rates)."

    options: [

      "B) 7% (the foregone investment return)",
      "A) 4.5% (the mortgage interest rate)",
      "C) 2.5% (the difference between returns)",
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: "**Opportunity Cost Analysis:**\n\nOpportunity cost is what you give up by making a choice.\n\nPaying off 4.5% mortgage guarantees a 4.5% return (saved interest). Investing offers expected 7% return.\n\n**Opportunity Cost = 7% - 4.5% = 2.5%**\n\nBy paying off the mortgage instead of investing, the client foregoes 2.5% annually. However, this ignores risk—the 4.5% is guaranteed while 7% is expected but uncertain. Risk-adjusted, the gap narrows."

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: "**Rule of 72:**\n\nYears to Double = 72 / Interest Rate\n\nYears = 72 / 8 = **9 years**\n\nThe Rule of 72 provides a quick approximation for doubling time. At 8%, money doubles every 9 years. This means $100,000 today becomes $200,000 in 9 years, $400,000 in 18 years, and $800,000 in 27 years—demonstrating the power of compounding."
