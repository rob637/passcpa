    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Recommendation development: analyze multiple approaches, consider trade-offs (cost, complexity, risk), align with client\'s specific goals, values, and constraints. Not one-size-fits-all—tailor to individual. Present rationale, discuss alternatives considered. Document analysis. Allow client input. Iterative process—may refine based on client feedback.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Scope definition: what\'s covered (and not), deliverables, timeline, fees, responsibilities. Benefits: client knows what to expect, planner knows what to deliver, prevents scope creep, reduces misunderstandings. Document in engagement letter. Can be comprehensive or limited engagement.

      'B) The discount rate that makes net present value of all cash flows equal to zero',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'IRR: rate where NPV = 0. Measures: return on invested capital considering all cash flows and timing. Calculation: iterative (calculators/software).

      'D) Tax effects',
      'B) The impact of compounding frequency on the true annual return, making rates with different compounding comparable',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'EAR: true annual rate accounting for compounding. Formula: EAR = (1 + i/n)^n - 1, where i = nominal rate, n = compounding periods. Example: 12% compounded monthly = (1 + 0.12/12)^12 - 1 = 12.68% EAR. Use: comparing accounts/loans with different compounding. APR vs. APY: APY is essentially EAR. More compounding = higher effective rate.'

    options: [
      'C) It has variable payments',
      'D) It lasts longer',
      'A) It pays less total',
      'B) Payments occur at the beginning of each period rather than the end, resulting in higher present and future values',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Annuity due: payments at period beginning. Ordinary: payments at period end. Annuity due values: multiply ordinary annuity value by (1 + r). Higher PV and FV because each payment has more time to earn/less time discounted. Examples: rent, insurance premiums (typically annuity due). Most investments assume ordinary annuity. Calculator setting: BGN vs. END mode.'

      'B) Building permits, stock prices, and manufacturing new orders, which tend to change before the overall economy',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Leading indicators: change before economy. Examples: building permits, stock market, manufacturing new orders, consumer expectations, jobless claims, credit conditions. Coincident: change with economy (employment, production). Lagging: change after (unemployment rate, loan delinquencies). Conference Board publishes composite index.

      'C) Short-term rates are controlled',
      'D) Inflation is always expected',
      'A) Longer-term bonds are always safer',
      'B) Investors demand higher yields for longer maturities due to greater interest rate risk and liquidity preference',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Normal yield curve: longer maturities = higher yields. Reasons: interest rate risk (longer duration = more price sensitivity), liquidity preference (investors prefer shorter, demand premium for longer), inflation uncertainty. Inverted curve: short > long (often signals recession). Flat: similar across maturities. Shape: has predictive value for economy and rate expectations.'

Expansionary: lower rates, buy securities. Contractionary: raise rates, sell securities. Goals: price stability, maximum employment. Monetary policy—different from fiscal (government spending/taxes).'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Emergency fund characteristics: liquid (access within days), stable (no market risk), accessible (no penalty). Options: high-yield savings, money market accounts, short-term CDs with no-penalty option, I-Bonds (after 1-year holding). Not stocks (volatile), not retirement accounts (penalties/taxes). Balance: enough return to maintain purchasing power, primary goal is availability.'

      'B) Time sensitivity, flexibility, consequences of not meeting goal, and which goals provide foundation for others',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Prioritization factors: time sensitivity (can\'t defer some), flexibility (can adjust some goals), impact of not meeting (essential vs. nice-to-have), foundational nature (emergency fund enables other goals). Framework: needs (essentials) → wants (lifestyle) → wishes (nice if possible). Client values matter—not just planner preference. Iterative—revisit as circumstances change.'

      'B) Ensures recommendations align with client preferences and increases likelihood of implementation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Client feedback value: confirms understanding, surfaces concerns, improves recommendations, builds buy-in.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Net worth tracking: snapshot → trend. Reveals: accumulation rate, debt reduction progress, investment growth, spending pattern impact. Calculate: at least annually, ideally quarterly. Components: what\'s growing/declining? Benchmarks: age-based targets, goal-based requirements. More meaningful than income alone.

      'A) Cannot be calculated',
      'B) Require growing annuity formulas that account for both time value and growth rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Growing (serial) payments: increase each period at fixed rate. Example: retirement income increasing 3% for inflation. Formula: involves relationship between growth rate (g) and discount rate (r). PV = PMT / (r - g) for simple growing perpetuity. Finite: more complex. Financial calculators: may not have built-in; use spreadsheets. Common in retirement planning with inflation adjustments.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Consumer confidence: survey-based measure of household sentiment. Key surveys: Conference Board (Consumer Confidence Index), University of Michigan (Consumer Sentiment). Components: current conditions, expectations. Why it matters: consumer spending ~70% of GDP. High confidence → more spending, lower saving. Useful for: economic forecasting, retail sector analysis.

      'B) Prioritizes debts by interest rate, paying highest-rate debt first to minimize total interest paid',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Avalanche method: order by interest rate (highest first). Mathematically optimal—minimizes total interest. Compare to snowball: order by balance (smallest first)—psychological wins motivate. Avalanche: better for disciplined, motivated. Snowball: better if need quick wins for motivation. Hybrid approaches exist. Both: make minimums on all, extra to target debt.'

    explanation: 'Review cadence: varies by client complexity and engagement. Common: annual comprehensive review. Triggers for interim: major life events (marriage, divorce, job change, inheritance), significant market moves, tax law changes, approaching milestones. Investment-focused: may be quarterly.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Risk management techniques: Avoidance (don\'t engage in risky activity), Reduction (minimize probability or impact), Retention (self-insure, accept risk), Transfer (insurance, contracts shift risk to others). Application depends on: risk magnitude, probability, cost of each approach. Combination common: reduce risk + insure residual + retain small exposures. Foundation for all insurance planning.'
