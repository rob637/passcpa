    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Net worth on a personal balance sheet is calculated as:',
    options: [
      'C) Total income minus total expenses',
      'A) Total assets plus total liabilities',
      'D) Liquid assets minus current liabilities',
      'B) Total assets minus total liabilities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Net worth = Total assets - Total liabilities. This represents what the client owns minus what they owe. It is a snapshot of financial position at a specific point in time, unlike a cash flow statement which shows flows over a period.'

    subtopic: 'Liquidity Ratios',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client has liquid assets of $25,000 and monthly expenses of $5,000. Their emergency fund ratio is:',
    options: [
      'A) 3 months',
      'C) 6 months',
      'D) 12 months',
      'B) 5 months',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Emergency fund ratio = Liquid assets ÷ Monthly expenses = $25,000 ÷ $5,000 = 5 months. Financial planners typically recommend 3-6 months of expenses in liquid reserves, though self-employed individuals or those in volatile industries may need more.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A household has gross monthly income of $10,000, a mortgage payment of $2,000, and other debt payments of $500. What is their total debt-to-income ratio?',
    options: [
      'A) 20%',
      'C) 28%',
      'D) 36%',
      'B) 25%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Total debt-to-income (back-end) ratio = Total debt payments ÷ Gross monthly income = ($2,000 + $500) ÷ $10,000 = 25%. Lenders typically prefer this ratio below 36%. The housing ratio (front-end) using only housing costs would be 20%.'

    options: [
      'D) 18%',
      'A) 10%',
      'C) 15%',
      'B) 12%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Savings rate = Annual savings ÷ Annual income = $18,000 ÷ $120,000 = 15%. A healthy savings rate is typically 15-20% of gross income, including employer retirement contributions. Some planners recommend even higher rates for aggressive retirement goals.'

    options: [
      'D) $8,000',
      'A) $6,209',
      'C) $7,350',
      'B) $6,806',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'PV = FV ÷ (1 + r)^n = $10,000 ÷ (1.08)^5 = $10,000 ÷ 1.4693 = $6,806. Present value discounts future cash flows to today\'s value using the time value of money principle that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future.'

      'D) $10,000',
      'A) $8,000',
      'B) $8,954',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'FV = PV × (1 + r)^n = $5,000 × (1.06)^10 = $5,000 × 1.7908 = $8,954. Compound interest allows earnings on both principal and accumulated interest, demonstrating the power of time in wealth accumulation.'

      'C) 9 years',
      'D) 12 years',
      'A) 6 years',
      'B) 8 years',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Rule of 72: Years to double = 72 ÷ Interest rate = 72 ÷ 9 = 8 years. This quick formula provides a reasonable approximation for doubling time. It can also be reversed: Required rate = 72 ÷ Years to double.'

      'D) Cannot be determined without more information',
      'C) They are equal',
      'A) Ordinary annuity',
      'B) Annuity due',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'An annuity due has a higher present value because payments occur at the beginning of each period, receiving cash flows one period sooner. PV annuity due = PV ordinary annuity × (1 + r). The timing difference gives annuity due payments more time to discount.'

      'B) Earnings grow tax-free and qualified withdrawals are tax-free',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Section 529 plans offer tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals for qualified education expenses. Contributions are not federally deductible but may receive state tax deductions.

      'A) Higher contribution limits',
      'C) Can be used for K-12 private school and expenses like computers',
      'D) State tax deductions are always available',
      'B) No income limits for contributors',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Coverdell ESAs can pay for K-12 expenses and qualified equipment like computers, offering more flexibility than 529 plans traditionally did (though 529s now cover K-12 tuition). However, Coverdells are limited to $2,000/year contributions and have income phase-outs for contributors.'

      'A) Earnings are never taxable',
      'D) There are strict contribution limits',
      'B) The child gains control at the age of majority',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'UGMA/UTMA custodial accounts are irrevocable gifts. When the child reaches the age of majority (18 or 21 depending on state), they gain full control and can use the funds for any purpose—not just education. This lack of control is a significant planning concern.'

      'D) Savings account in child\'s name',
      'B) 529 plan owned by the parent',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Grandparent-owned 529 plans are not reported as assets on the FAFSA (using SAI methodology). However, distributions were historically counted as student income. Under newer FAFSA rules (2024+), distributions from grandparent 529s are no longer counted as income, making them very advantageous for financial aid.'

      'C) Insurance policy details',
      'B) Risk tolerance and values',

    correctAnswer: 3,

Quantitative data includes measurable numerical information: income, expenses, assets, liabilities, insurance amounts, and account balances. Both types are essential for comprehensive financial planning.'

      'A) Making all decisions for the client',
      'B) Coordinating with other professionals and assisting client action',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'During implementation, the CFP® professional coordinates with other professionals (attorneys, CPAs, insurance agents), assists the client in taking action, and may execute recommendations within their authority. The client ultimately makes decisions; the planner facilitates and coordinates.'

      'C) The client has no debt',
      'A) High net worth',
      'B) Income exceeds expenses, allowing for saving',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Positive cash flow means income exceeds expenses during the period, leaving surplus for saving, investing, or debt reduction. Cash flow is a flow measure (period of time), while net worth is a stock measure (point in time). Positive cash flow does not guarantee high net worth or absence of debt.'

      'C) Primary residence',
      'A) Rental property',
      'B) Stock portfolio',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Use assets are personal property used for lifestyle (primary residence, automobiles, furniture). Investment assets generate income or appreciate (rental property, stocks, retirement accounts). The distinction matters for liquidity analysis and retirement planning—use assets don\'t typically generate retirement income.'

      'D) The payback period is less than one year',
      'B) The project\'s return exceeds the discount rate used',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A positive NPV means the project\'s expected return exceeds the discount rate (required rate of return). The investment adds value beyond the minimum acceptable return. NPV > 0 suggests acceptance; NPV < 0 suggests rejection. This is a key capital budgeting decision rule.'

      'C) 7%',
      'D) 10%',
      'B) 4%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Real rate ≈ Nominal rate - Inflation rate = 7% - 3% = 4%. The Fisher equation provides a more precise calculation: (1 + nominal) = (1 + real) × (1 + inflation), but the approximation is commonly used. Real returns reflect actual purchasing power growth.'

      'B) Increase each period by a constant percentage (often inflation)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Serial payments increase each period by a constant percentage, typically the inflation rate. This maintains purchasing power throughout retirement. Level annuity payments remain constant, losing purchasing power over time. Serial payment analysis is used in retirement income planning.'

      'B) Front-load 5 years of annual gift exclusion amounts without gift tax',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Superfunding allows contributors to make 5 years of gift exclusion contributions ($19,000 × 5 = $95,000 per donor in 2025) in a single year without using lifetime gift exemption, as long as no additional gifts are made to that beneficiary for 5 years.
