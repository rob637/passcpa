      'A) Initial data gathering',
      'C) Presenting the initial plan only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Monitoring is ongoing: review progress, evaluate whether strategies are working, update for life changes (marriage, job change, inheritance), adjust for market conditions and tax law changes. Financial planning is not one-time—it\'s a continuous process. Regular reviews (typically annual or triggered by events) are essential.'

      'D) Current income',
      'A) A liability',
      'B) An investment asset, often further categorized as a long-term or retirement asset',
      'C) A personal use asset',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Personal balance sheet assets include: monetary (cash, checking), investment (brokerage, retirement), and personal use (home, vehicles). 401(k) is an investment asset—specifically retirement/long-term. Some classify separately as retirement assets. Liabilities shown separately. Net worth = Assets - Liabilities.'

      'B) The degree to which investment income can cover current expenses, with 100% suggesting financial independence',
      'C) Savings rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Financial independence ratio: investment income ÷ living expenses. 100% means investment income covers all expenses (traditional retirement goal). Higher = more independence. Tracks progress toward retirement readiness. Related to FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) concepts. Consider: what income sources, how reliable, inflation adjustments.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client is comparing two savings accounts: Account A pays 6% compounded monthly, and Account B pays 6.1% compounded annually. Which account provides the higher effective annual rate?',
    options: [
      'Account A, because monthly compounding produces an EAR of approximately 6.17%',
      'Account B, because 6.1% exceeds 6.0%',
      'Both accounts produce the same effective annual rate',
      'Neither account — the EAR cannot be determined without knowing the deposit amount',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Account A\'s EAR = (1 + 0.06/12)^12 - 1 = 6.17%, which exceeds Account B\'s EAR of 6.1% (already annual). More frequent compounding increases the effective rate, so 6% compounded monthly actually yields more than 6.1% compounded annually.',

    question: 'Compared to an ordinary annuity with the same payment and rate, an annuity due:',
    options: [
      'B) Has higher present value and future value because payments occur at the beginning of each period',
      'A) Has lower present value',
      'D) Has the same value',
      'C) Is always better',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Annuity due: payments at beginning of period (rent, lease payments). Ordinary: payments at end (most loan payments). Annuity due values are higher by factor of (1 + i). PV_AD = PV_OA × (1 + i). FV_AD = FV_OA × (1 + i). Each payment earns interest for one more period in an annuity due.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'An investment doubles in 8 years. The approximate annual return using the Rule of 72 is:',
    options: [
      'B) 9%, because 72 divided by years to double equals the approximate rate',
      'D) 12%',
      'A) 8%',
      'C) 6%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Rule of 72: approximate years to double = 72 / interest rate, or interest rate ≈ 72 / years. 72 / 8 = 9%. Exact calculation: (2)^(1/8) - 1 = 9.05%. Close enough for quick estimation. Rule of 72 works best for rates 6-10%. Useful shortcut for mental math in planning discussions.'

      'D) Historical tax receipts',
      'C) Inflation only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Leading indicators predict future economic direction: stock prices, building permits, manufacturing orders, consumer expectations, initial jobless claims. Lagging: unemployment rate, CPI, business lending. Coincident: industrial production, personal income, GDP. Leading indicators help anticipate turns in business cycles.'

      'B) Increasing borrowing costs, potentially lowering bond and stock prices, while improving savings yields',
      'D) Reducing all asset values equally',
      'A) No effect',
      'C) Only affecting banks',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Higher rates impact planning: mortgage/loan costs increase (buy homes earlier or less debt), bond prices fall (longer duration hurts more), stocks may decline (higher discount rates, competition from bonds), savings yields improve. Planning implications: review debt strategy, bond duration, asset allocation, retirement income sources.'

      'D) Variable rate instruments',
      'A) Short-term savings only',
      'C) Equity investments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Purchasing power risk (inflation risk): money loses value over time. Fixed payments (bonds, pensions, annuities) particularly vulnerable—same dollars buy less. Long time horizons amplify: 3% inflation over 30 years means a dollar buys only 41 cents of today\'s goods. Planning must grow assets faster than inflation.'

      'A) Focus only on retirement',
      'C) Recommend borrowing for all goals',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Goal prioritization process: identify all goals, quantify costs and timing, determine which are needs vs. wants, analyze trade-offs (delay retirement vs. full college funding), adjust variables (goal cost, timeline, risk level). Transparent discussion helps clients understand constraints and make informed choices.'

      'B) Financial needs, risk tolerance, and planning priorities change systematically through different life stages',
      'C) Only retirement matters',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Life cycle approach: planning changes with life stage. Early career: build emergency fund, start retirement savings, manage student debt. Mid-career: maximize savings, education funding, insurance. Pre-retirement: catch-up contributions, assess readiness. Retirement: income planning, healthcare, estate. Priorities shift systematically.'

      'B) Job security, income stability, number of earners, insurance coverage, and access to other resources',
      'C) Investment returns only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Emergency fund factors: single earner (need larger), variable income (need larger), job stability, insurance deductibles, fixed expenses, access to credit/other funds. Typical: 3-6 months expenses. Self-employed or single income: 6-12 months. Consider: what emergencies are likely, how quickly could you find income, what other resources exist.'

      'D) Focusing only on investment preferences',
      'C) Immediately presenting solutions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Discovery goes beyond data collection. Essential: understand why (values driving goals), family dynamics, risk attitudes, past experiences with money, fears and concerns, what success looks like. Use open-ended questions. Listen actively. Quantitative data shows what; qualitative reveals why—both essential for comprehensive planning.'

      'D) No limit',
      'C) 20% or less',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Back-end DTI: all monthly debt payments ÷ gross monthly income. QM loans typically require ≤43%. FHA may allow up to 50% with compensating factors. Front-end (housing only): typically ≤28%. Lower DTI = more financial cushion. High DTI signals difficulty handling additional debt or expenses. Planning should aim to keep ratios manageable.'

    question: 'When evaluating an investment with uneven cash flows, NPV is superior to IRR because:',
    options: [
      'A) NPV is always positive',
      'B) IRR may have multiple solutions or assume reinvestment at unrealistic rates, while NPV uses consistent discount rate',
      'D) NPV ignores time value',
      'C) IRR is harder to calculate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRR limitations: assumes reinvestment at IRR (may be unrealistic), unconventional cash flows can produce multiple IRRs, can\'t compare projects of different sizes. NPV advantages: uses consistent required rate, additive (can compare different projects), no reinvestment rate assumptions. Use both—IRR for rate comparison, NPV for absolute value.'

      'D) Save 4% of income',
      'C) Returns must be 4%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: '4% rule (Bengen study): year one withdraw 4% of portfolio, subsequent years adjust for inflation. Based on historical returns, provided ~30-year sustainability. Limitations: based on specific period, single-country data, doesn\'t adapt to conditions. Modern views: consider flexibility, dynamic spending, CAPE-based rules.

      'C) Tax liability',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Investment assets-to-net worth: investment/income-producing assets ÷ total net worth. Higher ratio means wealth is in productive assets generating returns or income. Lower ratio may indicate too much in personal use (home, cars) that don\'t generate income. Important for retirement readiness—need investment assets to provide retirement income.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Growing annuity: payment grows at constant rate g. PV formula: PMT × [(1 - ((1+g)/(1+r))^n) / (r - g)]. Applications: retirement spending rising with inflation, salary savings increasing with raises, tuition growing each year. Requires different formula than level annuity.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Contraction (recession) planning: increase liquidity, build emergency fund, reduce variable debt, evaluate job security (update skills, network), cut discretionary spending, possibly find investment opportunities (if employed/secure). Counter-cyclical: add to investments when others sell (dollar-cost averaging works better in down markets).'

      'C) Investment account balance',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Human capital: PV of future earnings potential. For young workers, often largest "asset" (millions in lifetime earnings). Implications: protect with disability insurance, invest financial capital differently (stable job = can take more investment risk), invest in education to increase human capital, decreases over career as converted to financial capital.'
