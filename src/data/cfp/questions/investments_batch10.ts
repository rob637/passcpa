    topic: 'Investment Theory',
    subtopic: 'Efficient Frontier',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A portfolio on the efficient frontier represents:',
    options: [
      'A) Minimum return for each risk level',
      'B) Maximum expected return for a given level of risk, or minimum risk for a given return',
      'C) Average market performance',
      'D) Zero correlation investments'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Efficient frontier: the set of optimal portfolios offering highest expected return for each level of risk (or lowest risk for each return). Portfolios below the frontier are suboptimal—can achieve better return at same risk or same return at lower risk. Modern Portfolio Theory uses the frontier to guide asset allocation decisions.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Mean-variance optimization (MVO) limitations include:',
    options: [
      'A) It always works perfectly',
      'B) Sensitivity to input estimates, assumption of normal returns, and tendency to produce concentrated portfolios',
      'C) It ignores return entirely',
      'D) Only works with bonds'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'MVO limitations: small changes in expected returns dramatically alter allocations (estimation error sensitivity), assumes normal distributions (ignores fat tails), produces extreme allocations, uses historical data that may not predict future, ignores transaction costs and taxes. Practitioners use constraints, Black-Litterman model, or robust optimization to address.'

    topic: 'Investment Theory',
    subtopic: 'Arbitrage Pricing Theory',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'How does the multi-factor approach of Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) provide practical advantages for portfolio construction compared to CAPM?',
    options: [
      'APT simplifies analysis by using only a single market factor',
      'APT allows portfolio managers to identify and hedge multiple sources of systematic risk including inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth',
      'APT eliminates the need for historical data in estimating expected returns',
      'APT guarantees higher returns than CAPM-based portfolios',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'APT\'s multi-factor framework allows portfolio managers to identify specific sources of systematic risk (macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates, GDP growth) and construct portfolios that target or hedge those exposures. CAPM\'s single-factor (market beta) approach cannot distinguish between these risk sources.',

    topic: 'Asset Classes',
    subtopic: 'Convertible Securities',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A convertible bond with a conversion ratio of 25 shares is currently trading at $1,100 while the underlying stock trades at $38 per share. The bond\'s conversion value is $950. What does the premium over conversion value suggest?',
    options: [
      'The bond is trading below its investment value',
      'The $150 premium reflects the bond\'s income advantage (coupon) plus the optionality value of future stock price appreciation',
      'The stock price must decline for the conversion feature to have value',
      'The bond should be converted immediately to capture arbitrage profits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The convertible bond trades at $1,100 vs. its conversion value of $950 (25 × $38). The $150 premium exists because the bond provides current income (coupon payments) exceeding stock dividends plus the option value of conversion if the stock price rises, providing downside protection with upside participation.',

      'C) Floating rate notes',
      'B) Zero-coupon securities created by separating Treasury bond interest and principal payments',
      'D) Municipal securities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'STRIPS: Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal Securities. Treasury breaks apart a T-bond/note into individual cash flows (each coupon + principal = separate zero-coupon security). Benefits: known value at maturity, no reinvestment risk, useful for immunization. Drawback: phantom income taxed annually though no cash received—best in tax-deferred accounts.'

    options: [
      'A) Simple tax reporting',
      'C) Guaranteed returns',
      'B) Pass-through income with high distributions, often from energy infrastructure, with complex K-1 tax reporting',
      'D) Short-term trading opportunities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'MLPs: publicly traded partnerships (mostly energy/pipelines). Advantages: high distributions (often 6-8%), portions often return of capital (tax-deferred). Drawbacks: K-1 tax complexity, UBTI concerns in IRAs, concentrated sector exposure, distribution cuts possible. Distributions reduce basis—eventually creates taxable gain on sale or recapture.'

      'A) A growth stock',
      'B) A value stock that may be undervalued, or a company with fundamental problems',
      'D) Technology sector',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'P/B = Market price / Book value per share. Low P/B: stock may be undervalued relative to assets OR company has problems (poor earnings, obsolete assets). High P/B: market expects above-book returns or intangible assets create value. Particularly relevant for financial and industrial companies. Less useful for service or tech companies with few tangible assets.'

    question: 'A discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation requires:',
    options: [
      'B) Projections of future free cash flows and an appropriate discount rate reflecting risk',
      'A) Only historical data',
      'C) Comparable company multiples',
      'D) Dividend history only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'DCF valuation: intrinsic value = PV of projected future free cash flows. Requires: FCF projections (typically 5-10 years), terminal value (perpetuity growth or exit multiple), and discount rate (WACC or required return). Highly sensitive to assumptions—small changes in growth or discount rate dramatically affect value. Theoretically sound but practically challenging.'

    question: 'The interest coverage ratio measures:',
    options: [
      'A) Total debt to equity',
      'B) A company\'s ability to pay interest on debt, calculated as EBIT divided by interest expense',
      'C) Profit margins only',
      'D) Asset turnover'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Interest coverage = EBIT / Interest expense. Higher ratio = greater ability to meet interest obligations. Below 1.5: concerning. Above 3: generally comfortable. Important for: bond analysis, credit risk assessment, lending decisions. Low coverage increases default risk and may indicate excessive leverage or declining earnings.'

    options: [
      'B) Making short-term adjustments to asset class weights based on market outlook while maintaining a strategic baseline',
      'A) Never deviating from targets',
      'C) Constant trading',
      'D) Passive indexing only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Tactical allocation: temporary deviations from strategic (long-term) allocation to capitalize on perceived opportunities or avoid risks. Examples: overweighting stocks when undervalued, reducing bonds before expected rate increases. Balances active management with strategic discipline. Success depends on accurate market timing—often difficult to achieve consistently.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Diversification benefits are greatest when:',
    options: [
      'B) Assets have low or negative correlations, so losses in one may be offset by gains in another',
      'A) All assets are perfectly correlated',
      'C) Only one asset class is used',
      'D) Portfolio is concentrated',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Diversification reduces portfolio risk when assets don\'t move together. Optimal: low or negative correlation—when one zigs, another zags. Perfect correlation (+1): no diversification benefit. Negative correlation (-1): volatility reduction is dramatic. In practice, correlations often increase during crises when diversification is needed most.'

      'C) Avoids diversification',
      'B) Combines low-cost broad market index funds as the "core" with actively managed or specialized "satellite" positions',
      'A) Uses only active management',
      'D) Is only for institutions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Core-satellite: Core (60-80%): broad market index funds for efficient, low-cost market exposure. Satellites (20-40%): active managers, sector tilts, alternatives, individual positions for potential alpha. Benefits: cost efficiency in core while allowing active bets where manager skill may add value. Balances index benefits with tactical opportunities.'

    options: [
      'C) Annual returns',
      'B) The transaction cost embedded in trading, being the difference between buying and selling prices',
      'A) Daily price change',
      'D) Dividend yield',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Bid-ask spread: difference between highest price buyers offer (bid) and lowest price sellers accept (ask). It\'s an implicit transaction cost—buy at ask, sell at bid, lose the spread. Narrower spreads for liquid securities (large-cap stocks, Treasuries). Wider for illiquid (small-caps, some bonds, thinly traded). Matters especially for frequent trading.'

      'C) Tax reporting requirements',
      'A) Required by SEC',
      'D) Only for mutual funds',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'GIPS: voluntary global standards promoting fair representation and full disclosure in performance reporting. Administered by CFA Institute. Requirements include: time-weighted returns, composites of all discretionary portfolios, specific disclosure standards, verification requirements. Claiming GIPS compliance signals commitment to transparent, comparable reporting.'

    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A limit order differs from a market order in that:',
    options: [
      'C) Market orders are never used',
      'A) Limit orders always execute faster',
      'B) Limit orders specify maximum buy or minimum sell price, ensuring price but not execution',
      'D) Limit orders cost more in commissions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Market order: executes immediately at best available price—certainty of execution, not price. Limit order: specifies price—buy limit (max price to pay) or sell limit (min price to accept). May not execute if price you want isn\'t reached. Use limits for: illiquid securities, volatile markets, specific entry/exit points. Markets for: immediate execution priority.'

    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Unsystematic (idiosyncratic) risk:',
    options: [
      'A) Cannot be reduced',
      'C) Affects all stocks equally',
      'B) Is company or industry-specific risk that can be eliminated through diversification',
      'D) Determines risk premium',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Unsystematic/company-specific risk: factors unique to individual companies (management, products, competition). Diversifiable—holding more securities reduces this risk toward zero. Systematic/market risk: affects all securities (interest rates, recessions, inflation)—can\'t be diversified away. Investors are compensated only for systematic risk.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'High-yield (junk) bonds typically exhibit:',
    options: [
      'A) Very low volatility',
      'B) Higher yields compensating for greater default risk, with returns correlated more with equities than investment-grade bonds',
      'C) Guaranteed returns',
      'D) Government backing'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'High-yield bonds (below BBB-/Baa3): higher interest rates (spread over Treasuries) compensating for default risk. Behave more like stocks in stressed markets—correlations increase with equities. Can enhance returns but provide less diversification from stocks than investment-grade bonds. Defaults rise in recessions. Spread analysis helps assess relative value.'

    subtopic: 'Free Cash Flow',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Free cash flow (FCF) is important for valuation because:',
    options: [
      'B) It represents cash available to pay creditors and shareholders after funding operations and capital expenditures',
      'A) It equals net income',
      'C) It ignores working capital',
      'D) It\'s reported directly on income statements',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'FCF = Operating cash flow - Capital expenditures. It\'s the cash available for: dividends, share buybacks, debt repayment, acquisitions. Unlike earnings, FCF is harder to manipulate and represents actual cash generation. Positive FCF: company can reinvest, return capital, or pay down debt. Negative FCF: may need external financing. Key metric for DCF valuation.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Risk parity portfolio construction:',
    options: [
      'B) Allocates so each asset class contributes equally to total portfolio risk, often resulting in higher bond allocations',
      'A) Weights assets equally',
      'C) Maximizes returns regardless of risk',
      'D) Uses only stocks',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Risk parity: balance portfolio by risk contribution, not dollar amount. Since stocks are more volatile than bonds, equal risk contribution requires more bonds. Often uses leverage on bonds to achieve desired return. Result: more diversified risk profile, potentially smoother returns. Popular after 2008 when stock-heavy portfolios suffered. Bridgewater\'s All Weather is famous example.'

    question: 'After-tax return reporting for mutual funds:',
    options: [
      'A) Is not required',
      'B) Shows returns after taxes on distributions and after taxes on distributions plus sale, using standardized assumptions',
      'C) Uses actual investor taxes',
      'D) Only for tax-exempt funds'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'SEC requires mutual funds to report: pre-tax returns, after-tax returns on distributions (assuming you hold), after-tax returns on distributions and sale (assuming you sell). Uses highest marginal tax rates. Helps compare tax efficiency across funds. Important because taxes are often largest cost for taxable investors—even beyond expense ratios.'

      'A) Proving markets are always efficient',
      'B) Documenting systematic investor biases that create predictable mispricings the EMH should eliminate',
      'C) Ignoring all research',
      'D) Focusing only on technical analysis'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Behavioral finance: investors aren\'t always rational—cognitive biases (overconfidence, loss aversion, herding) create predictable patterns. Anomalies (momentum, value, size effects) persist despite being known—suggesting limits to arbitrage. Doesn\'t mean markets are easily beaten, but challenges the pure EMH view. Practical implication: behavior management matters as much as portfolio optimization.'

      'D) Short-term maturity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Preferred stock: hybrid—fixed dividend like bonds, equity treatment for issuers. Priority over common for dividends and liquidation, but subordinate to all debt. Usually no voting rights. Cumulative: missed dividends accumulate. Callable often. Interest rate sensitive like bonds. Qualified dividends for individuals in taxable accounts.'

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'DuPont ROE decomposition: (Net Income/Sales) × (Sales/Assets) × (Assets/Equity). Shows whether high ROE comes from: operational profitability (margin), asset utilization (turnover), or leverage. Same ROE can result from very different business models. Helps identify sources of return and analyze quality of earnings.'

      'B) The predetermined reduction in equity allocation as the target retirement date approaches',
      'D) Manager changes',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Glide path: how asset allocation shifts over time in target-date funds. Typically reduces equities as retirement approaches (e.g., 90% stocks at 30 years out → 40% at retirement). "To" funds stop at target, "through" funds continue de-risking past retirement. Glide paths vary significantly between fund families—compare carefully.'

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'U.S. equity settlement moved to T+1 in May 2024 (formerly T+2). Settlement = when ownership and cash actually transfer. T+1: trade Monday, settle Tuesday. Implications: need funds/securities available quickly, margin requirements, short selling rules. Corporate bonds: T+2. Government securities and some mutual funds: T+1 or same day.'
