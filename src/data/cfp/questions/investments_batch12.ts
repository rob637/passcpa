    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Tracking error measures:',
    options: [
      'A) Total portfolio risk',
      'C) Market volatility',
      'D) Trading costs',
      'B) The standard deviation of the difference between fund returns and benchmark returns over time',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Tracking error: measures how closely fund follows benchmark. Low tracking error: closely tracks (index funds aim for low). High tracking error: deviates significantly (active managers). Calculated: standard deviation of return difference over time. Sources: sampling, costs, cash drag, timing. For indexers: lower is better. Active: higher indicates manager is taking different positions.'

    question: 'The Sortino ratio differs from the Sharpe ratio by:',
    options: [
      'D) Measuring beta',
      'A) Using total return',
      'C) Ignoring risk-free rate',
      'B) Using downside deviation instead of standard deviation, focusing only on returns below target',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Sortino ratio: (Return - Target) / Downside Deviation. Unlike Sharpe: only penalizes downside volatility. Upside volatility is good—Sortino doesn\'t penalize it. Better for: asymmetric return distributions, when clients care about downside more than volatility generally. Higher is better. Target often risk-free rate or 0%. More intuitive for many investors—downside is what hurts.'

      'A) Markets always go up',
      'C) Returns are random',
      'B) Extreme performance tends to be followed by performance closer to long-term averages',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Mean reversion: extreme deviations tend to correct toward long-term average. Implications: top-performing funds may underperform, beaten-down assets may recover. Basis for: value investing, rebalancing benefits, contrarian strategies. Not guaranteed: some trends persist. Time horizon matters—mean reversion more reliable over longer periods. Supporting rationale for disciplined rebalancing.'

      'A) Default risk',
      'B) Homeowners paying mortgages early when rates fall, reducing expected interest income and returning principal sooner',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Prepayment risk: homeowners refinance when rates drop. MBS holder gets principal back early—must reinvest at lower rates. Return of principal, not loss. Affects: duration (contracts when rates fall), yield. CMOs allocate prepayment risk differently across tranches. Extension risk: opposite—rates rise, prepayments slow, duration extends. MBS have negative convexity—worst of both worlds.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'ADRs: foreign company shares held by depositary bank, certificates trade on U.S. exchanges. Benefits: U.S. dollar pricing, familiar trading, U.S. settlement. Still subject to: currency risk, foreign withholding taxes (some), country risk. Types: Level I (OTC), Level II/III (exchange listed). GDRs: similar concept for European markets. Convenient international diversification vehicle.'

      'A) Revenue bonds are riskier always',
      'B) Revenue bonds are backed by specific project income, while GO bonds are backed by issuer\'s full taxing power',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'General Obligation (GO) bonds: backed by full faith, credit, and taxing power of issuer. Revenue bonds: backed only by specific revenue source (tolls, utility payments, etc.). GO generally safer—can raise taxes. Revenue: assess the project economics. Both typically tax-exempt. Revenue may have higher yields due to narrower backing. Due diligence differs for each type.'

      'B) Seeks to capture documented risk premiums, accepting periods of underperformance, based on academic research',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Factor investing: target documented premiums—value, size, momentum, quality, low volatility. Based on academic research (Fama-French, others). Premiums: not guaranteed, can underperform for extended periods. Implementation: factor funds, smart beta ETFs, stock selection. Requires: discipline through underperformance, diversification across factors. Different from market-cap indexing or traditional active.'

      'A) Is always inferior to calendar rebalancing',
      'C) Ignores market movements',
      'D) Requires daily monitoring',
      'B) Responds to actual allocation drift and may be more tax-efficient than fixed calendar rebalancing',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Threshold rebalancing: rebalance when allocation drifts X% (e.g., 5% absolute or 25% relative). Benefits: responds to actual drift, may trade less in stable markets, captures mean reversion when triggered. Comparison to calendar: potentially fewer trades, more responsive. Considerations: monitoring required, execution logistics. Hybrid approach common: review periodically, rebalance if thresholds exceeded.'

      'B) Tax implications, transaction costs, market impact, and timing of exposure changes',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Portfolio transition: moving from current to target allocation. Considerations: embedded gains/losses (tax-loss harvest vs. wash sales), transaction costs (commissions, spreads, impact), exposure gaps (maintain market exposure during transition), opportunity cost. Strategies: staged transition, in-kind transfers, tax-loss pairing. For large portfolios: may use transition manager. Plan carefully—rushed transitions costly.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'NIIT: 3.8% surtax on investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains, rents, royalties, passive income). Applies when: MAGI > $200K (single) or $250K (MFJ). Tax on lesser of: net investment income OR excess MAGI over threshold. Not indexed for inflation. Planning: reduce MAGI, time income recognition, use tax-exempt investments. Adds to regular income tax and capital gains tax.'

    question: 'When a taxable bond is purchased at a premium:',
    options: [
      'A) Premium is a capital loss at maturity',
      'D) Premium is immediately deductible',
      'C) No tax implications',
      'B) Premium can be amortized annually to reduce interest income, with basis reduction, or basis maintained for capital loss at maturity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Bond premium amortization (taxable bonds): can elect to amortize annually—reduces interest income, reduces basis. Alternative: don\'t amortize, take capital loss at maturity/sale. Tax-exempt bonds: must amortize (no choice), reduces basis. Constant yield method typically used. Election affects: current income, future gain/loss. Decision factors: marginal rates now vs. later, holding period expectations.'

      'C) Only used in non-retirement accounts',
      'B) Claimed as a tax credit or itemized deduction, with credit usually providing greater benefit',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Foreign tax credit: reduces U.S. tax dollar-for-dollar (subject to limitations). Itemized deduction: reduces taxable income only. Credit generally better (direct tax reduction vs. tax times marginal rate). Limitation: can\'t exceed U.S. tax on foreign income. For small amounts (<$600 married filing jointly): may not need Form 1116. International funds provide 1099 with foreign tax paid. Credit usually preferred.'

      'A) Risk of total loss',
      'C) Interest rate changes',
      'B) Difficulty selling an investment quickly at fair value, potentially requiring price concession',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Liquidity risk: can\'t sell quickly without price impact. Examples: real estate, private equity, small-cap stocks in volume, some bonds. Manifests as: wide bid-ask spreads, time to sell, forced selling at discount. Planning: match liquidity to needs, liquidity premium expected in less liquid assets. Matters most when need cash unexpectedly. Core holdings should be liquid.'

      'A) Past performance only',
      'B) Expense ratio, tracking difference, index methodology, and tax efficiency',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Index fund selection: expense ratio (lower is better, directly impacts return), tracking difference (actual return vs. index, not just error), index methodology (what\'s included, how weighted), tax efficiency (turnover, qualified dividends). Also: fund size, bid-ask spread (for ETFs), securities lending income. Small differences compound significantly over time. Not all index funds are equal.'

      'B) The predetermined transition from growth-oriented to conservative allocation as the target date approaches',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Glide path: planned asset allocation change over time. Target-date funds: reduce equity, increase bonds as retirement approaches. "To" retirement: reaches most conservative at target date. "Through" retirement: continues adjusting past target. Compare glide paths—significant differences between fund families. Consider: risk at target date, post-retirement allocation. Not one-size-fits-all—evaluate if appropriate.'

      'B) Deduction for fair market value while avoiding capital gains tax on appreciation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Charitable gifts of appreciated stock: deduct FMV (up to 30% AGI for public charities), no capital gains tax on appreciation. Better than selling and donating cash—avoids tax on gain. Requirements: held >1 year, donated to qualifying charity. For depreciated stock: sell, take loss, donate cash. Donor-advised funds accept stock. Often most tax-efficient way to give for those with appreciated holdings.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'VaR: answers "What\'s the most I can lose at X% confidence?" Example: 95% 1-day VaR of $10K means 95% of days, won\'t lose more than $10K. Doesn\'t measure: tail risk (the 5% worst), maximum possible loss. Methods: historical, parametric, Monte Carlo. Limitations: assumes normal conditions, understates tail risk. Useful but not comprehensive risk measure. Often supplemented with stress testing.'

      'B) Staged selling, exchange funds, collars, charitable donations, and qualified opportunity zone reinvestment',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Concentrated position strategies: staged selling (spread gains over years), hedging (collars—buy puts, sell calls), exchange funds (contribute stock, get diversified exposure), charitable giving (QCDs, CRTs), qualified opportunity zones (reinvest gains, defer/reduce tax), borrowing against (no sale trigger). Each has trade-offs: costs, complexity, tax impact, restrictions. Match to specific situation and goals.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Constructive sale (Section 1259): if you eliminate substantially all risk while keeping position, treated as sale for tax purposes. Triggers: short against the box (now covered), certain collars (too tight), forward contracts locking in price. Purpose: prevent permanent tax deferral on gains while locking in economics. Planning: ensure hedges don\'t cross line—sufficient risk remains. Consult tax advisor for complex situations.'

      'B) Suggests long holding periods reduce risk, but is debated as cumulative dollar risk may still increase',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Time diversification: idea that longer horizons reduce risk (variance of annualized returns decreases). Debate: true for return rates, but absolute dollar risk may increase (larger portfolio at risk longer). Implications: argument for stocks in long-term portfolios. Critics: dollar amount at risk grows over time. Both perspectives have merit. Practical: longer horizons can tolerate more volatility, but isn\'t riskless.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Investment grade: BBB-/Baa3 or higher. High-yield (junk): BB+/Ba1 and below. Rating agencies: S&P, Moody\'s, Fitch. Investment grade: lower default risk, lower yields. High-yield: higher default risk, higher yields. Many institutional investors: restricted to investment grade. Crossover: "fallen angels" (downgraded to HY), "rising stars" (upgraded to IG).

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'LDI: match assets to liabilities—duration, timing, amount. Common for: pensions, annuities, known future obligations. Techniques: immunization (match duration), cash flow matching, dedicated portfolios. Reduces: interest rate mismatch risk, reinvestment risk. Trade-off: may sacrifice return for certainty. Individual application: retirement income, education funding, known future expenses. Security over maximization.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'In-kind distribution: receive securities instead of cash from IRA/401(k). Tax: FMV at distribution is ordinary income (same as cash withdrawal). New basis: FMV at distribution date. Future appreciation from new basis. Uses: want to keep specific holding, NUA transaction for employer stock. Not generally advantageous vs. cash unless specific strategy (like NUA).

      'B) Stock prices reflect all publicly available information, making fundamental analysis unable to consistently generate excess returns',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Semi-strong EMH: prices reflect all public information. Implications: fundamental analysis can\'t consistently beat market—information already in price. Weak form: technical analysis doesn\'t work (past prices reflected). Strong form: even insider info reflected (empirically false). Debate continues: markets generally efficient, but anomalies exist.
