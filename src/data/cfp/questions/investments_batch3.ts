    question: 'Portfolio X has an expected return of 10% and standard deviation of 15%. Portfolio Y has an expected return of 10% and standard deviation of 12%. According to Modern Portfolio Theory:',
    options: [
      'X is preferred because of higher risk',
      'Y dominates X because it has the same return with lower risk',
      'Both portfolios are equally efficient',
      'Neither portfolio can be on the efficient frontier'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'For the same expected return (10%), a rational investor prefers lower risk. Portfolio Y dominates X because it offers identical returns with 3% less volatility. X is inefficient and Y is preferred.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The wash sale rule disallows the loss if substantially identical securities are purchased within 30 days before or after the sale. However, the disallowed loss increases the basis of the replacement shares, preserving the tax benefit for later.',
