    subtopic: 'Efficient Market Hypothesis',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Under the semi-strong form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), which investment strategy would be LEAST likely to generate excess returns?',
    options: [
      'D) Both A and B',
      'A) Technical analysis using price charts',
      'C) Insider trading using nonpublic information',
      'B) Fundamental analysis of financial statements',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Semi-strong EMH states that stock prices reflect all publicly available information. This means both technical analysis (which uses historical prices) and fundamental analysis (which uses public financial data) cannot consistently generate excess returns. Only insider trading using nonpublic information could theoretically beat the market, but it is illegal.'

    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'According to Modern Portfolio Theory, which factor primarily determines the risk-return characteristics of a well-diversified portfolio?',
    options: [
      'A) Individual security selection',
      'D) Security trading frequency',
      'C) Asset allocation',
      'B) Market timing decisions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Studies show that asset allocation explains approximately 90% of a portfolio\'s return variability over time. In a well-diversified portfolio, unsystematic risk is minimized, leaving systematic (market) risk as the primary driver of portfolio performance. Individual security selection matters far less than the overall asset mix.'

      'D) Rise 11.4%',
      'A) Rise 10%',
      'B) Rise 14%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Beta measures a stock\'s sensitivity to market movements. A beta of 1.4 means the stock is expected to move 1.4 times the market movement. Market up 10% × 1.4 beta = 14% expected stock increase. Stocks with beta > 1 are more volatile than the market; beta < 1 are less volatile.'

      'D) Expected return of an asset',
      'A) Only downside risk',
      'B) Total volatility of returns from the mean',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Standard deviation measures the dispersion of returns around the mean—both above and below. It represents total risk (volatility). A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability in returns. Unlike semi-variance or downside deviation, it treats upside and downside deviations equally.'

    question: 'A bond portfolio has a duration of 6 years. If interest rates rise by 1%, the portfolio value would be expected to:',
    options: [
      'C) Increase by 6%',
      'A) Decrease by 6%',
      'D) Remain unchanged',
      'B) Decrease by 1%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Duration measures a bond\'s price sensitivity to interest rate changes. A duration of 6 means approximately a 6% price change for each 1% change in rates. Bond prices move inversely to interest rates, so a 1% rate increase causes approximately a 6% decrease in value. This is known as the modified duration approximation.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Analysis',
    question: 'When the yield curve becomes inverted, a bond portfolio manager should consider which strategic response?',
    options: [
      'Extending duration to maximize capital gains if rates fall during recession',
      'Moving entirely to equities to avoid bond market volatility',
      'Maintaining a barbell strategy regardless of yield curve shape',
      'Selling all fixed-income holdings immediately',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'An inverted yield curve historically signals potential economic slowdown or recession, often followed by falling interest rates as the Fed eases monetary policy. Extending duration positions the portfolio for capital appreciation when rates decline, as longer-duration bonds benefit most from falling rates.',

    question: 'A $1,000 par value bond with a 5% coupon is trading at $1,050. The bond is trading:',
    options: [
      'A) At par',
      'C) At a discount because market rates are higher than 5%',
      'D) At a premium because market rates are higher than 5%',
      'B) At a premium because market rates are lower than 5%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'When a bond trades above par value, it trades at a premium. This occurs when the coupon rate exceeds current market rates for similar bonds. Investors pay more for the higher coupon payments. Conversely, bonds trade at a discount when market rates exceed the coupon rate.'

    question: 'Which type of bond adjusts its principal value based on inflation?',
    options: [
      'A) Zero-coupon bond',
      'D) Convertible bond',
      'C) Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)',
      'B) Callable bond',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'TIPS are U.S. Treasury securities whose principal adjusts based on changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The coupon rate is fixed, but applied to the inflation-adjusted principal, providing protection against inflation. At maturity, investors receive the greater of the original or adjusted principal.'

    question: 'A stock pays a $2 annual dividend expected to grow at 5% indefinitely. The required return is 12%. Using the constant growth dividend discount model, the intrinsic value is:',
    options: [
      'D) $40.00',
      'A) $16.67',
      'C) $30.00',
      'B) $28.57',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The Gordon Growth Model (constant growth DDM) values a stock as: D₁ / (r - g) where D₁ is next year\'s dividend. D₁ = $2 × 1.05 = $2.10. Value = $2.10 / (0.12 - 0.05) = $2.10 / 0.07 = $30.00. The model requires r > g for a positive value.'

      'A) 5',
      'D) 320',
      'C) 20',
      'B) 15',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'P/E ratio = Price per share / Earnings per share = $80 / $4 = 20. This means investors are willing to pay $20 for each $1 of earnings. A higher P/E may indicate growth expectations or overvaluation; a lower P/E may suggest value opportunity or concerns about future earnings.'

      'A) High P/E ratios and rapid earnings growth',
      'D) High beta and high volatility',
      'C) No earnings and high growth potential',
      'B) Low P/E ratios and high dividend yields',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Value stocks typically have low P/E ratios, low price-to-book ratios, and higher dividend yields. They are often mature companies trading below their intrinsic value. Growth stocks, conversely, have high P/E ratios reflecting expectations of rapid earnings growth, often with low or no dividends.'

      'D) $11',
      'C) $8',
      'A) $3',
      'B) $5',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Call option profit = Intrinsic value - Premium paid. Intrinsic value = Stock price - Strike price = $58 - $50 = $8. Profit = $8 - $3 premium = $5 per share. The breakeven price is $53 ($50 strike + $3 premium). Max loss is limited to the premium paid.'

      'D) Unlimited',
      'C) $7 per share',
      'A) $2 per share',
      'B) $5 per share',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Covered call maximum profit = (Strike - Stock purchase price) + Premium = ($50 - $45) + $2 = $7 per share. If the stock rises above $50, shares are called away at $50. The premium provides income and limited downside protection but caps upside at $7 per share.'

      'D) Reduce the cost basis of stock positions',
      'A) Generate income on existing stock positions',
      'B) Limit downside risk while maintaining upside potential',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A protective put (also called a married put) involves buying a put option on stock you own. This creates a floor price equal to the strike price, limiting downside losses while allowing unlimited upside potential minus the premium cost. It\'s like buying insurance on your stock position.'

      'A) 50%',
      'C) 90%',
      'D) 100%',
      'B) 75%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'REITs must distribute at least 90% of taxable income as dividends to shareholders. This allows REITs to avoid corporate-level taxation, passing income directly to investors. Additionally, at least 75% of assets must be in real estate, and 75% of income must come from real estate-related sources.'

      'A) Are available to all investors regardless of income',
      'D) Must be registered with the SEC and provide daily pricing',
      'B) Are more liquid with daily redemption rights',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Hedge funds have fewer regulatory restrictions than mutual funds, allowing them to employ strategies like short selling, leverage, derivatives, and concentrated positions. They are typically available only to accredited investors and have longer lock-up periods with limited liquidity. They are not required to register with the SEC under the same rules as mutual funds.'

      'D) Have no storage or rollover costs',
      'A) Always provide positive returns',
      'C) Are guaranteed to outperform during recessions',
      'B) Have low or negative correlation with stocks and bonds',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Commodities historically have low or negative correlation with traditional stock and bond portfolios. This diversification benefit can reduce overall portfolio volatility without necessarily sacrificing returns. Commodities may also provide inflation protection as their prices often rise with inflation.'

      'D) 1.25',
      'C) 1.00',
      'B) 0.80',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Sharpe ratio = (Return - Risk-free rate) / Standard deviation = (12% - 3%) / 15% = 9% / 15% = 0.60. The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return—higher is better. It indicates 0.60% excess return per unit of risk taken. Compare to benchmark or similar funds.'

      'C) Has a beta greater than 1.0',
      'B) Generated returns above what was expected given the risk taken',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Alpha measures the excess return of an investment relative to its expected return based on beta (systematic risk). Positive alpha means the manager added value beyond what was expected for the level of market risk taken. Alpha is a key measure of manager skill.'

      'A) 10%',
      'C) 15%',
      'B) 13%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'CAPM: Expected Return = Risk-free rate + Beta × (Market return - Risk-free rate). Expected Return = 4% + 1.5 × (10% - 4%) = 4% + 1.5 × 6% = 4% + 9% = 13%. CAPM determines the theoretically appropriate required return given systematic risk (beta).'

      'A) A zero-coupon bond maturing in 10 years',
      'B) A 10-year bond with a 8% coupon',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Reinvestment risk is the risk that coupon payments will be reinvested at lower rates. Higher coupons = more cash flow to reinvest = more reinvestment risk. The 8% coupon bond generates the most cash flow to reinvest. Zero-coupon bonds have no reinvestment risk because there are no interim payments.'

      'D) They are always issued at a discount',
      'A) They have longer maturities',
      'B) Investors bear call risk and demand compensation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Callable bonds give the issuer the right to redeem the bond before maturity, usually when rates fall. This benefits issuers but hurts investors who must reinvest at lower rates. To compensate investors for this call risk, callable bonds offer higher coupon rates than comparable non-callable bonds.'

      'A) Concentrating all investments in long-term bonds',
      'B) Buying bonds with staggered maturity dates',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A bond ladder spreads investments across bonds with different maturity dates (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years). As each bond matures, proceeds are reinvested at the longest maturity. This balances reinvestment risk, provides regular liquidity, and averages interest rate exposure over time.'

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Unhedged international investments expose investors to both the performance of foreign stocks AND changes in currency exchange rates. A strong foreign market can still result in losses for a US investor if the foreign currency weakens against the dollar. Hedging can reduce currency risk but adds cost.'
