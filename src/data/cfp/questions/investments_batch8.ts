    topic: 'Investment Theory',
    subtopic: 'Efficient Frontier',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Analysis',
    question: 'A portfolio on the efficient frontier:',
    options: [
      'C) Contains only stocks',
      'D) Is always the optimal choice for all investors',
      'B) Offers the highest expected return for a given level of risk, or lowest risk for a given return',
      'A) Has the lowest possible risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The efficient frontier represents portfolios with optimal risk-return trade-offs. Moving along it requires accepting more risk for more return. Portfolios below the frontier are suboptimal (higher risk for same return). The specific point chosen depends on investor risk tolerance.'

    topic: 'Investment Theory',
    subtopic: 'Information Ratio',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A portfolio manager with a high information ratio is MOST likely demonstrating which investment skill?',
    options: [
      'Minimizing total portfolio volatility relative to the market',
      'Consistently generating excess returns relative to the benchmark with controlled active risk',
      'Maintaining a portfolio beta close to 1.0',
      'Achieving the highest absolute return regardless of risk taken',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A high information ratio indicates the manager consistently generates meaningful excess returns (alpha) relative to the benchmark while maintaining controlled tracking error (active risk). This demonstrates genuine security selection and/or sector allocation skill rather than simply taking more risk.',

    subtopic: 'Factor Investing',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Which factor is commonly targeted in a multi-factor investment strategy alongside value and momentum?',
    options: [
      'Currency risk exposure in domestic equities',
      'Quality — measured by profitability, earnings stability, and low leverage',
      'Dividend yield above 5% exclusively',
      'Geographic concentration in a single country',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Factor investing targets specific drivers of return including value, momentum, quality, size, and low volatility. The quality factor selects companies with high profitability, stable earnings, low debt, and strong corporate governance, which have historically produced premium risk-adjusted returns.',

    topic: 'Fixed Income',
    subtopic: 'Municipal Bond Yield',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A municipal bond yields 3.5%. For an investor in the 32% federal tax bracket, the taxable equivalent yield is approximately:',
    options: [
      'D) 2.38%',
      'B) 5.15%',
      'C) 4.62%',
      'A) 3.5%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Taxable Equivalent Yield = Tax-Free Yield ÷ (1 - Tax Rate) = 3.5% ÷ (1 - 0.32) = 3.5% ÷ 0.68 = 5.15%. This helps compare munis to taxable bonds. The higher the tax bracket, the more attractive municipal bonds become.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Floating rate notes (FRNs) have:',
    options: [
      'B) Interest payments that adjust periodically based on a reference rate, reducing interest rate risk',
      'C) No credit risk',
      'D) Longer durations than fixed-rate bonds',
      'A) Fixed interest payments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'FRNs have coupons tied to reference rates (like SOFR) plus a spread. As rates rise, coupons increase, keeping prices stable. This gives them very low duration (interest rate sensitivity). They maintain credit risk based on issuer quality but hedge rate risk.'

    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Total return on a stock includes:',
    options: [
      'B) Both price appreciation and dividend income',
      'C) Only dividends',
      'D) Only capital gains distributions',
      'A) Only price appreciation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Total return = Capital Appreciation + Dividend Yield. Focusing only on price changes ignores income—historically about 40% of equity returns have come from dividends. Total return is the appropriate measure for evaluating investment performance.'

    topic: 'Portfolio Construction',
    subtopic: 'Core-Satellite',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'In a core-satellite portfolio strategy, which type of investment is typically used for the \'core\' allocation?',
    options: [
      'Actively managed sector-specific funds with concentrated positions',
      'Low-cost, broadly diversified index funds or ETFs representing the market',
      'Individual high-growth technology stocks',
      'Leveraged inverse ETFs for hedging purposes',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The core portion (typically 60-80% of the portfolio) uses low-cost, broadly diversified index funds or ETFs to provide market exposure and stable returns. The satellite portion uses active strategies, alternative investments, or tactical positions seeking alpha.',

    topic: 'Portfolio Construction',
    subtopic: 'Rebalancing',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Analysis',
    question: 'The primary purpose of portfolio rebalancing is to:',
    options: [
      'D) Minimize taxes',
      'C) Time the market',
      'B) Maintain target risk levels by selling appreciated assets and buying underperformers',
      'A) Maximize returns',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Rebalancing restores target allocations after market movements change portfolio composition. Without rebalancing, portfolios drift toward riskier assets during bull markets. It enforces buy-low/sell-high discipline. Frequency involves trade-offs between precision and transaction costs/taxes.'

    subtopic: 'Tax-Loss Harvesting',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When implementing tax-loss harvesting, the wash sale rule:',
    options: [
      'C) Only applies to gains',
      'D) Does not apply to ETFs',
      'B) Disallows the loss deduction if substantially identical securities are purchased within 30 days before or after the sale',
      'A) Allows immediate repurchase of identical securities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The wash sale rule prevents claiming losses when repurchasing substantially identical securities within the 61-day window (30 days before through 30 days after). The disallowed loss is added to the new position\'s basis. Investors often use similar (but not identical) funds to maintain exposure while harvesting.'

    topic: 'Security Analysis',
    subtopic: 'PEG Ratio',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The PEG ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth) is calculated by:',
    options: [
      'C) Price ÷ Earnings growth',
      'D) Growth rate ÷ P/E ratio',
      'B) P/E ratio ÷ Earnings growth rate, with lower values suggesting better value relative to growth',
      'A) P/E ratio × Growth rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'PEG = (P/E Ratio) ÷ (Earnings Growth Rate). A stock with P/E of 20 and 20% growth has PEG of 1.0. PEG below 1 may suggest undervaluation relative to growth; above 1 may indicate overvaluation. It adjusts for the fact that high-growth stocks deserve higher P/E ratios.'

    subtopic: 'Dividend Discount Model',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Using the constant growth dividend discount model, a stock paying a $2 dividend, growing at 5%, with a required return of 10% is worth:',
    options: [
      'D) $50',
      'C) $42',
      'B) $40',
      'A) $20',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Gordon Growth Model: Value = D₁ ÷ (r - g) = D₀(1+g) ÷ (r - g) = $2(1.05) ÷ (0.10 - 0.05) = $2.10 ÷ 0.05 = $42. The model requires growth rate less than required return and assumes constant perpetual growth.'

    subtopic: 'Free Cash Flow',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Free cash flow (FCF) represents:',
    options: [
      'D) Net income only',
      'B) Cash generated after operating expenses and capital expenditures, available for distribution or reinvestment',
      'C) Total cash on the balance sheet',
      'A) Revenue minus expenses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Capital Expenditures. It represents discretionary cash available for dividends, debt repayment, share buybacks, or reinvestment. Strong FCF indicates financial flexibility. It\'s often preferred over earnings because it\'s harder to manipulate.'

  // INV-5: Risk Management
  {
    id: 'cfp-inv-b8-013',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-INV',
    blueprintArea: 'INV-5',
    topic: 'Risk Management',
    subtopic: 'Downside Capture',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Analysis',
    question: 'A fund with a downside capture ratio of 70% means:',
    options: [
      'B) When the benchmark declines, the fund captures only 70% of the loss on average',
      'D) Downside risk is eliminated 70% of the time',
      'C) It has 70% of its assets in defensive stocks',
      'A) It loses 70% in down markets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Downside capture below 100% indicates the fund loses less than the benchmark in down markets (defensive). A 70% downside capture means if the benchmark loses 10%, the fund loses only 7% on average. Combined with upside capture, it shows asymmetric performance characteristics.'

    id: 'cfp-inv-b8-015',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-INV',
    blueprintArea: 'INV-5',
    topic: 'Risk Management',
    subtopic: 'Conditional VaR',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), also called Expected Shortfall:',
    options: [
      'C) Ignores tail risk',
      'B) Measures the expected loss given that the VaR threshold has been exceeded',
      'D) Only applies to options',
      'A) Is the same as VaR',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'CVaR (Expected Shortfall) answers "If we exceed VaR, how bad could it get?" While 95% VaR might be -5%, CVaR asks what the average loss is in that worst 5% of cases. It captures tail risk better than VaR alone. For example, CVaR might show expected loss of -8% when VaR is breached.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'The disposition effect causes investors to:',
    options: [
      'C) Take excessive risks',
      'B) Sell winners too early and hold losers too long to avoid realizing losses',
      'D) Over-diversify',
      'A) Buy only index funds',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The disposition effect is the tendency to sell appreciated investments quickly (locking in gains) while holding losing positions (hoping to avoid realizing losses). This is tax-inefficient (realizing gains triggers taxes, losses create deductions) and can hurt returns by cutting winners and riding losers.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'A long/short equity hedge fund:',
    options: [
      'C) Invests only in bonds',
      'D) Uses no leverage',
      'B) Takes both long positions (expecting appreciation) and short positions (expecting decline) to profit from stock selection in either direction',
      'A) Only buys stocks',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Long/short funds buy undervalued stocks and short overvalued ones. This can profit in any market direction from the manager\'s stock-picking skill. Net exposure (longs minus shorts) can vary. The approach aims to generate alpha while reducing market risk compared to long-only strategies.'

      'D) Avoid international investments',
      'B) Automatically shift from aggressive to conservative allocations as the target retirement date approaches',
      'A) Guarantee returns by the target date',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Target date funds use a "glide path" that starts equity-heavy and gradually shifts toward bonds/cash as retirement approaches. They provide automatic rebalancing and risk adjustment, making them simple "set and forget" options. The allocation at retirement and beyond (the "landing point") varies by provider.'

    question: 'EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is useful for:',
    options: [
      'D) Determining dividend payments',
      'B) Comparing profitability across companies with different capital structures and accounting policies',
      'C) Measuring cash on hand',
      'A) Calculating taxes owed',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'EBITDA strips out financing decisions (interest), tax situations (which vary), and non-cash charges (depreciation/amortization). This allows comparison of operating profitability across companies regardless of debt levels or accounting choices. However, it ignores real capital needs and shouldn\'t replace cash flow analysis.'

    question: 'Currency hedging in international investing:',
    options: [
      'C) Guarantees higher returns',
      'D) Is only used for emerging markets',
      'B) Reduces or eliminates exchange rate fluctuations that can affect returns from foreign investments',
      'A) Eliminates all foreign investment risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Currency hedging uses forwards or futures to neutralize exchange rate movements. A U.S. investor owning European stocks would otherwise see returns affected by EUR/USD changes. Hedging focuses returns on the underlying investments. Whether to hedge is a strategic choice—currencies can hurt or help returns.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) differs from CAPM in that:',
    options: [
      'B) APT allows multiple risk factors beyond market beta to explain returns',
      'D) CAPM is more complex',
      'C) APT doesn\'t consider risk',
      'A) APT uses only one factor (market risk)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'APT uses multiple factors (like inflation, industrial production, interest rates) rather than CAPM\'s single market factor. It doesn\'t specify which factors—they\'re empirically determined. APT is more flexible but less prescriptive than CAPM. Factor models bridge the two approaches.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) provide:',
    options: [
      'D) Negative real returns always',
      'B) Principal that adjusts with CPI, providing protection against inflation while maintaining Treasury credit quality',
      'C) No interest payments',
      'A) Fixed nominal payments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'TIPS adjust principal semi-annually based on CPI changes. Interest payments are calculated on the adjusted principal, so both principal and income keep pace with inflation. This provides real return certainty (current yield minus expected inflation). At maturity, you receive the greater of adjusted or original principal.'

    options: [
      'C) Only buying at market lows',
      'B) Investing fixed amounts at regular intervals, buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when high',
      'D) Timing the market',
      'A) Investing a lump sum immediately',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'DCA spreads purchases over time with fixed dollar amounts, naturally buying more shares at lower prices. It reduces timing risk and provides psychological comfort. While lump-sum investing historically outperforms (more time in market), DCA suits regular payroll investing and reduces regret risk.'

      'C) Is underleveraged',
      'D) Has equal debt and equity',
      'A) Has no debt',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'D/E of 1.5 means 60% debt financing, 40% equity (debt is 1.5× equity). Higher D/E increases financial risk—interest must be paid regardless of earnings. Appropriate leverage varies by industry. Utilities often have high D/E (stable cash flows); tech companies often lower D/E.'

      'C) Always outperform shorter duration bonds',
      'D) Have no interest rate risk',
      'A) Mature in 7 years',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Duration estimates price sensitivity to rate changes. A duration of 7 means approximately 7% price change for each 1% rate change (inverse relationship). If rates rise 1%, prices fall ≈7%; if rates fall 1%, prices rise ≈7%. Longer duration = more interest rate risk but often higher yields.'
