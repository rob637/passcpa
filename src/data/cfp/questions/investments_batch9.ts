    subtopic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A financial planner notices that a client consistently holds losing stock positions for years while quickly selling any position that gains 10%. This pattern is BEST explained by:',
    options: [
      'Mean reversion theory applied to individual stocks',
      'The disposition effect — a tendency to realize gains too early and hold losers too long',
      'Efficient market hypothesis and rational pricing',
      'Dollar-cost averaging behavior',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The disposition effect, rooted in prospect theory, describes investors\' tendency to sell winning investments too quickly (to lock in gains) while holding losing investments too long (to avoid realizing losses). This behavior is tax-inefficient and often leads to suboptimal portfolio performance.',

    subtopic: 'Risk-Free Rate',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'The risk-free rate used in investment analysis typically refers to:',
    options: [
      'A) Corporate bond yields',
      'C) S&P 500 returns',
      'D) Bank savings rates',
      'B) The return on short-term U.S. Treasury securities, representing return with minimal default and inflation risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The risk-free rate is the theoretical return of an investment with zero risk. U.S. Treasury bills (or similar government securities) are used as proxies—minimal default risk (full faith and credit) and short maturities minimize inflation/interest rate risk. It anchors the expected return calculation for risky assets.'

    options: [
      'D) No price patterns',
      'A) Only random pricing',
      'C) Perfect market efficiency',
      'B) The January effect, momentum, value premium, and small-cap premium that persist despite being documented',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Anomalies are patterns inconsistent with pure market efficiency: January effect (small stocks outperform in January), momentum (recent winners continue winning short-term), value premium (high book-to-market outperforms), size premium (small caps outperform long-term). Debate continues whether these represent risk premiums or true inefficiencies.'

    question: 'The Capital Market Line (CML) represents:',
    options: [
      'D) Individual security prices',
      'A) All possible portfolios',
      'C) Only stock investments',
      'B) The risk-return trade-off for efficient portfolios that combine the risk-free asset with the market portfolio',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The CML plots expected return vs. total risk (standard deviation) for combinations of the risk-free asset and market portfolio. It\'s the most efficient set of portfolios—any point below the line is suboptimal. Slope = (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Market Std Dev = Sharpe Ratio of market portfolio.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The Security Market Line (SML) differs from the CML in that it:',
    options: [
      'C) Only applies to portfolios',
      'D) Ignores the risk-free rate',
      'A) Uses total risk',
      'B) Plots expected return vs. beta (systematic risk), showing the required return for any security based on its market risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'SML uses beta (systematic risk), not total risk. It plots individual securities and portfolios: Expected Return = Risk-Free + β(Market Risk Premium). Securities above the SML are undervalued (return exceeds what beta implies); below are overvalued. CAPM generates the SML relationship.'

    options: [
      'C) Average market return',
      'D) Individual stock volatility',
      'A) Total portfolio return',
      'B) The standard deviation of the difference between portfolio returns and benchmark returns',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Tracking error quantifies how closely a portfolio follows its benchmark. High tracking error = significant deviation (active management). Low tracking error = close benchmark replication (index funds). Index funds target very low tracking error; active managers accept higher tracking error seeking alpha.'

    topic: 'Asset Classes',
    subtopic: 'TIPS',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client concerned about unexpected inflation increasing in retirement wants to add TIPS to their fixed income allocation. What is a key limitation of TIPS that the planner should disclose?',
    options: [
      'TIPS do not provide any inflation adjustment to their principal',
      'TIPS may underperform nominal bonds in periods of stable or declining inflation, and their inflation adjustment is taxable annually',
      'TIPS are only available with 30-year maturities',
      'TIPS cannot be held in tax-advantaged retirement accounts',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'While TIPS protect against inflation, they typically offer lower real yields than nominal bonds when inflation remains stable. Additionally, the inflation adjustment to principal is taxable as ordinary income each year (phantom income), even though the investor doesn\'t receive it until maturity or sale.',

    question: 'Private equity investments typically:',
    options: [
      'C) Guarantee returns',
      'A) Trade on public exchanges',
      'D) Are highly liquid',
      'B) Involve owning shares in private companies, have multi-year lockups, and are suitable only for accredited investors',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Private equity: investing in non-public companies. Structures include buyouts (acquiring existing companies), venture capital (early-stage), growth equity, and distressed investments. Characteristics: illiquid (10+ year lockups typical), high minimums, limited to accredited/qualified investors, capital calls, potential high returns with substantial risk.'

    subtopic: 'Convertible Securities',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Convertible bonds offer investors:',
    options: [
      'A) Only interest income',
      'C) Guaranteed conversion profits',
      'D) Higher yields than regular bonds',
      'B) Bond income with the option to convert to a fixed number of common shares, participating in stock appreciation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Convertibles are hybrid securities: bond features (coupon, maturity, priority in bankruptcy) plus equity option (convert to stock at set ratio). They typically yield less than straight bonds—investors pay for conversion privilege. Performance is bond-like when stock is low, equity-like when stock exceeds conversion price.'

    topic: 'Investment Strategies',
    subtopic: 'Tactical Asset Allocation',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Tactical asset allocation differs from strategic allocation by:',
    options: [
      'C) Only investing in bonds',
      'A) Never changing the portfolio',
      'D) Ignoring risk tolerance',
      'B) Making short-term adjustments to asset weights based on market conditions while maintaining long-term strategic targets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Strategic allocation sets long-term targets based on goals and risk tolerance. Tactical makes temporary deviations—overweighting/underweighting based on perceived opportunities or risks. Example: reducing equity exposure if markets seem overvalued. Success requires skill in timing; many advisers stick to strategic-only.'

    topic: 'Investment Strategies',
    subtopic: 'Bond Immunization',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Bond portfolio immunization involves:',
    options: [
      'C) Only buying short-term bonds',
      'A) Avoiding bonds entirely',
      'D) Maximizing yield',
      'B) Matching portfolio duration to the investment horizon, protecting against interest rate changes affecting funds needed at a specific future date',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Immunization matches duration to time horizon. If rates rise, price losses are offset by higher reinvestment returns; if rates fall, lower reinvestment is offset by price gains. The portfolio value at horizon is preserved regardless of rate changes. Requires periodic rebalancing as duration shifts with time and rate changes.'

    question: 'Direct indexing offers advantages including:',
    options: [
      'A) Lower costs than ETFs',
      'D) Simple implementation',
      'C) Guaranteed outperformance',
      'B) Owning individual securities allows tax-loss harvesting on specific positions and customization of the index',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Direct indexing: owning the underlying stocks rather than a fund. Benefits: harvest losses on individual positions throughout the year, customize exclusions (ESG, concentrated positions), potentially avoid embedded gains in funds. Drawbacks: complexity, higher costs (trading, management), typically requires significant portfolio ($100K+).'

  // INV-5: Performance Measurement
  {
    id: 'CFP-INV-B9-013',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-INV',
    blueprintArea: 'INV-5',
    topic: 'Performance',
    subtopic: 'Jensen\\',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A portfolio has a Jensen\'s alpha of -0.5%. What does this indicate about the portfolio manager\'s performance?',
    options: [
      'The portfolio returned 0.5% more than the risk-free rate',
      'The portfolio underperformed its expected return based on its systematic risk by 0.5%',
      'The portfolio\'s Sharpe ratio is negative',
      'The portfolio had 0.5% less volatility than the market',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Jensen\'s alpha measures the difference between a portfolio\'s actual return and its expected return based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). A negative alpha of -0.5% means the manager underperformed the CAPM-expected return by 50 basis points, suggesting the manager did not add value through active management.',

    topic: 'Performance',
    subtopic: 'Sortino Ratio',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'When would the Sortino ratio be MOST appropriate for evaluating a portfolio instead of the Sharpe ratio?',
    options: [
      'When the portfolio returns are symmetrically distributed',
      'When the investor is primarily concerned about downside risk and the return distribution is negatively skewed',
      'When comparing portfolios with identical standard deviations',
      'When evaluating index funds that track the market',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The Sortino ratio replaces total standard deviation with downside deviation, making it more appropriate when returns are asymmetrically distributed (negatively skewed) or when the investor is primarily concerned about downside risk. Unlike the Sharpe ratio, it does not penalize upside volatility.',

    topic: 'Performance',
    subtopic: 'Attribution Analysis',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Performance attribution analysis decomposes returns into:',
    options: [
      'D) Calendar year results',
      'C) Total return only',
      'A) Gains and losses only',
      'B) Components like asset allocation decisions, security selection, and interaction effects relative to a benchmark',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Attribution identifies return sources: asset allocation effect (sector weights vs. benchmark), security selection effect (individual security picks within sectors), and interaction (combined effect). This helps evaluate whether manager skill is in allocation or selection, and which decisions added or subtracted value.'

    topic: 'Investment Theory',
    subtopic: 'Mean Reversion',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Mean reversion in investments suggests that:',
    options: [
      'C) Markets are always efficient',
      'D) Diversification doesn\'t work',
      'A) Prices always go up',
      'B) Returns and prices tend to return toward their long-term average over time',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Mean reversion: extremes tend to normalize over time. High P/E ratios suggest lower future returns; low valuations suggest higher returns. This underlies contrarian strategies. It doesn\'t mean timing is easy—deviation from mean can persist for years. Also applies to individual securities, sectors, and even volatility.'

    subtopic: 'Correlation Over Time',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Asset class correlations during market crises often:',
    options: [
      'A) Decrease, improving diversification',
      'C) Remain constant',
      'D) Become negative',
      'B) Increase, as investors sell risky assets indiscriminately, reducing diversification benefits when most needed',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Correlation instability is crucial for planning: correlations measured in normal times may increase during crises. "Flight to quality" means risky assets decline together while safe havens rise. This reduces diversification precisely when it\'s most needed. Stress testing should assume higher crisis correlations.'

    question: 'Agency bonds issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) like Fannie Mae:',
    options: [
      'C) Are tax-exempt',
      'A) Are guaranteed by the U.S. government',
      'D) Have no credit risk',
      'B) Have implicit government backing but are not explicitly guaranteed, offering slightly higher yields than Treasuries',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'GSE bonds (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Federal Home Loan Banks) have implicit—not explicit—government backing. During 2008 crisis, government did support GSEs. They typically yield slightly more than Treasuries due to the technical lack of guarantee. Some agency securities (Government National Mortgage Association) are explicitly backed.'

    topic: 'Investment Strategies',
    subtopic: 'Dividend Capture',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A dividend capture strategy attempts to:',
    options: [
      'C) Hold stocks for years',
      'A) Avoid dividends',
      'D) Invest only in bonds',
      'B) Buy stocks before ex-dividend date to receive dividends, then sell shortly after, collecting dividends across multiple positions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Dividend capture: buy before ex-dividend, sell after. Theoretically, stock price drops by dividend amount on ex-date, so profit comes from the price not falling by the full amount. High transaction costs, tax implications (short-term vs. qualified dividends), and price volatility make this strategy difficult to execute profitably.'

    topic: 'Performance',
    subtopic: 'Time vs Dollar Weighting',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Time-weighted return is preferred over dollar-weighted for manager evaluation because it:',
    options: [
      'A) Always produces higher returns',
      'C) Is simpler to calculate',
      'D) Includes all client contributions',
      'B) Eliminates the impact of client cash flows, which are outside the manager\'s control',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Time-weighted: geometrically links sub-period returns, neutralizing cash flow timing. Dollar-weighted (IRR) includes cash flow timing effects. A manager receiving large inflows before a down period would show lower dollar-weighted returns despite the same investment skill. GIPS standards require time-weighted for performance reporting.'

    question: 'Monte Carlo simulation in investment planning:',
    options: [
      'A) Predicts exact future returns',
      'C) Eliminates investment risk',
      'D) Is only for gambling analysis',
      'B) Generates thousands of random scenarios based on assumed return and volatility parameters to estimate probability of outcomes',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Monte Carlo runs thousands of simulations with randomized returns within assumed parameters. Instead of a single deterministic projection, it produces a probability distribution of outcomes (e.g., 85% probability of not running out of money). It captures return sequence risk and helps stress-test plans, though results depend on input assumptions.'

      'A) Maximum diversification only',
      'C) Individual stock picking',
      'B) Specific characteristics (value, momentum, size, quality, low volatility) historically associated with excess returns',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Factors are characteristics explaining returns beyond market exposure. Common factors: value (cheap vs. expensive), size (small vs. large), momentum (recent performance), quality (profitability, low leverage), low volatility. Factor investing systematically tilts toward these characteristics, often through smart beta funds. Premiums aren\'t guaranteed and may underperform for extended periods.'

      'B) Combine derivatives with bonds to create customized payoffs, often with principal protection but capped upside',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Structured products package derivatives with traditional securities for specific payoffs: principal protection, enhanced income, leveraged returns. Common types: equity-linked notes, structured CDs, principal-protected notes. Complexity, embedded costs, issuer credit risk, illiquidity, and cap on returns are concerns. Suitable only for investors understanding the trade-offs.'

      'D) Ignores market movements',
      'A) Keeps fixed asset allocation',
      'B) Increases equity exposure as the portfolio rises above a floor value and decreases when approaching the floor',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'CPPI: Cushion = Portfolio Value - Floor. Equity exposure = Multiplier × Cushion. As portfolio grows above floor, equity allocation increases; as it approaches floor, allocation decreases to protect principal. It\'s a dynamic strategy providing downside protection with upside participation. Can underperform in volatile, range-bound markets.'

      'A) Average annual return',
      'B) The largest peak-to-trough decline before a new peak, indicating worst-case loss experience',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Maximum drawdown: the worst decline from any peak to subsequent trough. A portfolio hitting $100K, declining to $60K = 40% max drawdown. It captures what investors actually experience—the pain of watching portfolios decline. Particularly important for retirees taking distributions (sequence risk). Lower max drawdown suggests more consistent returns.'
