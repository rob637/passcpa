    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A CFP® professional provides a one-time recommendation to purchase a specific annuity but is not engaged in comprehensive financial planning. Does fiduciary duty apply?',
    options: [
      'B) Yes, fiduciary duty applies "at all times" when providing Financial Advice',
      'C) Only if the client pays a fee for the recommendation',
      'A) No, fiduciary duty only applies during financial planning engagements',
      'D) Only if the CFP® professional holds out as a fiduciary',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under the CFP Board\'s Standards of Conduct (effective October 2019), CFP® professionals owe a fiduciary duty "at all times" when providing Financial Advice—not just during comprehensive financial planning engagements. A one-time product recommendation is Financial Advice and triggers fiduciary duty regardless of whether it\'s part of a broader planning relationship.'

    question: 'Which of the following is NOT one of the four principles in the CFP Board\'s Code of Ethics?',
    options: [
      'C) Maximize investment returns for clients',
      'A) Act with honesty, integrity, competence, and diligence',
      'B) Act in the client\'s best interests',
      'D) Maintain the standards of the profession',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The four Code principles are: (1) Act with honesty, integrity, competence, and diligence; (2) Act in the client\'s best interests; (3) Exercise due care; and (4) Maintain the standards of the profession. "Maximize investment returns" is NOT a principle—recommendations must be in the client\'s best interest considering all factors, not just maximizing returns.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Evaluation',
    question: 'A CFP® professional discovers they receive 50% higher commissions on Product A versus Product B, though both are suitable for the client. According to the duty of loyalty, what action is required?',
    options: [
      'A) Recommend Product A because both are suitable and either is permissible',
      'C) Recommend Product B to avoid any appearance of conflict',
      'B) Recommend whichever product is in the client\'s best interest, regardless of compensation',
      'D) Decline to make any recommendation due to the conflict',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The duty of loyalty requires placing the client\'s interests first. The CFP® must recommend whichever product is actually in the client\'s best interest—which may be A or B depending on features, costs, and client needs. Higher commissions cannot influence the recommendation. If Product A is truly best for the client, recommend it. If B is better, recommend B. Document the analysis.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A CFP® professional cannot avoid a conflict of interest. What steps must they take according to the Standards of Conduct?',
    options: [
      'A) Decline the engagement entirely',
      'C) Proceed without disclosure if the conflict is immaterial',
      'B) Disclose the conflict and manage it appropriately',
      'D) Obtain approval from CFP Board before proceeding',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The conflict management framework requires: First, try to avoid the conflict. If avoidance isn\'t possible, disclose the conflict in writing before providing advice, and manage the conflict through appropriate steps. Material conflicts must be disclosed clearly so the client can make an informed decision. Declining is not required if proper disclosure and management occur.'

      'A) Recommending a Roth IRA contribution strategy',
      'C) Selling a life insurance policy',
      'D) Giving advice on asset allocation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The seven-step financial planning process is required when providing Financial Planning—a collaborative process that develops strategies to achieve the client\'s comprehensive goals. One-time advice (Roth strategy, asset allocation) and product sales are Financial Advice, which triggers fiduciary duty but not the full seven-step process.'

    options: [
      'B) Accept the limited scope if client understands limitations, document it, and refer for other needs',
      'A) Decline the engagement—all areas must be addressed',
      'C) Expand the engagement without the client\'s consent to ensure adequate coverage',
      'D) Provide retirement advice but disclaim responsibility for other areas',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Limited-scope engagements are permitted when the client understands and accepts the limitations. The CFP® should document the scope in writing, explain what\'s excluded, and refer the client to other professionals for out-of-scope needs. However, if limiting scope would harm the client (e.g., ignoring an obvious tax issue), the CFP® must address it or decline.'

    options: [
      'C) Within 30 days after providing advice',
      'B) Before or at the time of engagement',
      'A) Only when asked by the client',
      'D) Only when the conflict affects the recommendation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Material conflicts must be disclosed in writing before or at the time of engagement. This timing allows the client to make an informed decision about whether to proceed. Waiting until after advice is given or only disclosing when asked fails to meet the standard. The disclosure must be clear, detailed, and in writing.'

      'A) Sharing information with other firm employees for marketing purposes',
      'D) Discussing the client\'s situation with a colleague for general advice',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Exceptions to confidentiality include: legal requirements (subpoenas, court orders), client consent, defense against charges, CFP Board investigations, and disclosure to professionals working with the client (with appropriate safeguards). A subpoena is a legal requirement that permits disclosure of the requested information. Marketing and journalist inquiries are not permitted.'

      'C) Avoiding all risks in client portfolios',
      'A) Achieving guaranteed positive investment returns',
      'D) Maximizing commission income while meeting suitability',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The Duty of Care requires acting with the skill, care, prudence, and diligence that a prudent professional would exercise. This is a process standard—focusing on HOW decisions are made, not guaranteeing outcomes. Returns cannot be guaranteed, appropriate risk is part of investing, and compensation must not influence recommendations.'

      'C) Report the conduct if it raises genuine concern',
      'B) Maintain confidentiality about colleague misconduct',
      'A) Report to CFP Board only if asked during an investigation',
      'D) Wait until the colleague is caught through other means',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'CFP® professionals should report conduct that raises genuine concerns about another CFP® professional\'s fitness. Theft of client funds is a serious violation requiring action. This supports the duty to maintain standards of the profession. The report should be made in good faith. Silence allows harm to continue and undermines professional integrity.'

      'B) Refer to or collaborate with a competent estate planning professional',
      'D) Provide generic estate planning information from the internet',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'CFP® professionals must be competent in areas where they provide advice. Options when not competent: (1) decline to advise in that area, (2) refer to appropriate professionals, or (3) collaborate with competent professionals. Simply declining the entire engagement isn\'t required if other needs can be addressed while referring estate matters appropriately.'

      'B) Scope of engagement, responsibilities, compensation, and conflicts',
      'D) Names of all other clients with similar situations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'A Financial Planning engagement agreement must include: scope of engagement, client and CFP® responsibilities, compensation and payment terms, conflicts of interest, and duration/termination provisions. It creates a mutual understanding of the relationship. Returns cannot be guaranteed, medical history is generally not required, and sharing other client names would violate confidentiality.'

      'C) Immediately terminate without any communication',
      'A) Stop returning the client\'s calls until they go away',
      'B) Provide reasonable notice and transition assistance',
      'D) Wait until the next billing cycle ends regardless of circumstances',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'When terminating a client relationship, the CFP® should provide reasonable notice, return client property/records as appropriate, and offer transition assistance if requested. Ghosting clients or immediate termination without communication fails to meet professional standards. The goal is to minimize harm to the client from the transition.'

      'C) FINRA',
      'D) Department of Labor',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Investment advisers with $100 million or more in AUM must register with the SEC. Below $25 million requires state registration. Between $25-100 million allows a choice but generally requires state registration unless in multiple states. FINRA regulates broker-dealers, not investment advisers directly.

      'C) Broker-dealers have higher fiduciary standards',
      'D) There is no meaningful distinction'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Investment Advisers primarily provide investment advice for fees (AUM, hourly, flat) and have full fiduciary duty under the Investment Advisers Act. Broker-Dealers primarily execute securities transactions for commissions and are subject to Reg BI (best interest at recommendation). The distinction affects regulatory registration, compensation models, and standards of conduct.'

    explanation: 'Form CRS must be delivered to retail investors before or at the earliest of: a recommendation, placing a trade, or opening an account. It provides a plain-English summary of services, fees, conflicts, and standards of conduct. Both investment advisers and broker-dealers with retail customers must provide Form CRS.'

    explanation: 'Form ADV Part 2A is the "brochure" delivered to advisory clients. It describes services, fees, conflicts of interest, and disciplinary history in plain English. Part 1 is primarily for SEC registration. Part 2B is the "brochure supplement" describing individual advisers. Form CRS (sometimes called Part 3) is a separate relationship summary.'

    explanation: 'Reg BI applies to broker-dealers and their associated persons when making securities recommendations to retail customers.

      'D) FINRA',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Insurance is regulated primarily by states, not the federal government. Each state has an insurance commissioner (or equivalent) who licenses agents, approves products, and enforces regulations. The NAIC coordinates among states but is not a regulatory body. Variable products have dual regulation (state insurance + SEC/FINRA for securities aspects).'

      'A) Only a state insurance license',
      'D) Only CFP® certification',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Variable annuities are both insurance products and securities because their values depend on separate account performance. This dual nature requires dual licensing: a state insurance license for the insurance contract, and a securities license (Series 6 or 7) for the securities component. CFP® certification alone does not authorize sales.'

      'D) Best efforts standard',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'ERISA imposes the "prudent expert" standard—a higher standard than ordinary prudence.

      'D) The advisor\'s compensation only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under DOL fiduciary rules, rollover recommendations are fiduciary advice requiring documentation of: why the rollover (versus keeping funds in the plan) is in the client\'s best interest, comparison of fees and services, alternatives considered, and rationale. The IRA may have higher fees, so there must be offsetting benefits (better advice, planning integration, etc.).'

    explanation: 'FINRA Rule 2165 allows firms to place a temporary hold on disbursements (up to 25 business days) when there\'s a reasonable belief of financial exploitation of a senior or vulnerable adult.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Prohibited transaction rules prevent self-dealing between plans and "parties in interest" (fiduciaries, employers, service providers). This includes selling property to the plan, lending to or from the plan, and using plan assets for personal benefit. These rules protect participants by preventing conflicts from harming plan assets.'

    explanation: 'The three-part test for Investment Adviser status: (1) provides advice or analysis about securities, (2) is in the business of providing such advice (regularly, holding out), and (3) receives compensation for the advice. Meeting all three makes you an Investment Adviser subject to registration requirements unless an exclusion applies.'

    explanation: 'Receiving 12b-1 fees creates a Material Conflict of Interest because the CFP® professional has a financial incentive to recommend or retain funds that pay higher trails.
