    subtopic: 'Client Interest First',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When a client requests a strategy that is legal but not in the client\'s best financial interest, the CFP® professional should:',
    options: [
      'A) Implement the request without comment since the client is always right',
      'C) Refuse to implement the request under any circumstances',
      'B) Document concerns, explain why the strategy may not be optimal, provide alternatives, and implement only if the client persists after being fully informed',
      'D) Refer the client to another professional',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'CFP® professionals must act in clients\' best interests but clients retain autonomy. The professional should document concerns, explain potential issues, offer better alternatives, and ensure informed consent. If the client still wants to proceed after understanding the implications, implementation with documentation is appropriate.'

      'D) Pass the CFP® exam every 5 years',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Competence requires attaining and maintaining knowledge and skill needed to provide services competently. When facing unfamiliar areas, professionals should seek additional education, consult experts, or decline/refer the engagement. Continuing education helps maintain competence, but it must go beyond minimum requirements when needed.'

      'D) Continue without any changes to the engagement',

    explanation: 'Joint clients create shared confidentiality, but divorce creates conflicting interests. The professional faces a material conflict and may need to withdraw from representing both. Options include continuing with conflicts waivers, representing neither, or representing one with the other\'s consent. Documentation is essential.'

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Duty to inquire means following up when something doesn\'t add up—inconsistent information, unrealistic assumptions, apparent misunderstanding.

      'D) Verbal disclosure only'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Material conflict disclosure must be specific enough for clients to understand how conflicts might affect advice. This includes all compensation methods (commissions, fees, bonuses), revenue sharing, product incentives, proprietary product requirements, and any relationships that could bias recommendations.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Broker-dealers must establish, maintain, and enforce written supervisory procedures (WSPs) tailored to their business.

      'D) After services are rendered',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Full fee disclosure must occur before engagement, allowing clients to make informed decisions.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Documentation should demonstrate the basis for recommendations, including client circumstances, analysis performed, alternatives considered, and rationale for recommendations made.

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Analysis',
    question: 'The requirement that CFP® professionals receive only reasonable and disclosed compensation means:',

      'B) Compensation must be disclosed, proportionate to value provided, and not create incentives to recommend unsuitable products',
      'A) Fees cannot exceed industry averages',
      'C) All CFP® professionals must charge the same rates',
      'D) Commission-based compensation is prohibited',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Reasonable compensation considers value provided, complexity, and market rates. The key is full disclosure and alignment of incentives. Compensation structures shouldn\'t drive recommendations that aren\'t in client interest. Neither fee-only nor commission-based is inherently more "fiduciary"—transparency and alignment matter.'

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'SEC registration requires $100M+ AUM (with exceptions). Smaller advisers register with state(s) where they maintain a place of business or have clients, subject to de minimis exemptions.
