    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client refuses to sell a stock at a 20% loss even though fundamentals have deteriorated, saying "I can\'t lock in this loss." This behavior demonstrates:',

      'A) Overconfidence bias',
      'C) Recency bias',
      'D) Confirmation bias',
      'B) Loss aversion',

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client says, "I bought this house for $400,000, so I won\'t sell for less than that even though values have dropped." This illustrates:',

      'D) Status quo bias',
      'A) Anchoring bias',
      'C) Mental accounting',
      'B) Endowment effect',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Anchoring occurs when decisions are unduly influenced by an initial reference point. The purchase price serves as an anchor that affects the client\'s selling decision, even when current market conditions suggest a different value.'

    subtopic: 'Overconfidence',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client consistently believes their stock picks will outperform the market despite a track record of underperformance. This demonstrates:',

      'D) Self-attribution bias',
      'A) Optimism bias',
      'C) Illusion of control',
      'B) Overconfidence bias',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Overconfidence bias leads people to overestimate their knowledge, skills, or the precision of their predictions. This client believes in their abilities despite evidence to the contrary, which can lead to excessive trading and poor diversification.'

    subtopic: 'Recency Bias',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'After a strong year in the stock market, a client wants to move their bond allocation entirely into stocks. This is likely influenced by:',
    options: [
      'A) Recency bias',
      'D) Availability bias',
      'C) Hindsight bias',
      'B) Representativeness bias',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Recency bias occurs when recent events are given disproportionate weight in decision-making. The client is extrapolating recent strong returns into future expectations, ignoring longer-term patterns and the value of diversification.'

    subtopic: 'Confirmation Bias',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',

      'D) Familiarity bias',
      'A) Selection bias',
      'B) Confirmation bias',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Confirmation bias leads people to seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms their existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. This can result in poorly diversified portfolios and failure to recognize investment risks.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client refuses to use a $50,000 "vacation fund" savings account to pay off 18% credit card debt, saying "that money is for vacations." This is an example of:',

      'C) Mental accounting',
      'A) Endowment effect',
      'B) Framing effect',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Mental accounting involves treating money differently based on subjective criteria like source or intended use, rather than recognizing all money is fungible. Financially, paying off 18% debt would provide a guaranteed "return" higher than typical savings.'

      'B) Prefer the current state of affairs over change',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Status quo bias describes the preference for the current state of affairs. Even when change would be beneficial, people tend to stick with existing choices. This can manifest as failure to rebalance, update beneficiaries, or change inappropriate investment allocations.'

      'D) Tax avoidance strategies',
      'B) Money scripts formed in childhood',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Money scripts are unconscious beliefs about money formed in childhood, often from family experiences. Growing up in scarcity can create scripts around safety and hoarding that persist even when circumstances change dramatically.'

    id: 'cfp-psy-b2-010',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-PSY',

    topic: 'Family Dynamics',
    subtopic: 'Spousal Differences',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'In a couple, one spouse is a "spender" and one is a "saver." As their planner, the BEST approach is to:',
    options: [
      'C) Facilitate a compromise that addresses both perspectives',
      'A) Side with the saver since saving is financially optimal',

      'B) Recommend the spender be excluded from financial decisions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'A skilled planner acts as a neutral facilitator, helping couples find common ground. Both spending and saving have value—the plan should incorporate both immediate enjoyment and future security in a way both partners can accept.'
  },
  {
    id: 'cfp-psy-b2-011',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-PSY',

      'C) Focus only on tax minimization strategies',
      'D) Discourage disclosure of estate plans to beneficiaries',
      'B) Explore the family\'s values and dynamics regarding inheritance',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Effective intergenerational planning requires understanding family dynamics, values, and the parents\' goals. Equal distributions aren\'t always optimal (different needs, contributions, or family circumstances), and communication about plans often reduces rather than increases conflict.'
  },

    id: 'cfp-psy-b2-012',

      'B) Recommend waiting and avoiding major decisions during emotional transitions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Major life transitions like divorce are emotionally charged periods when decision-making can be impaired. Best practice is to make only necessary changes initially and wait for emotional stability before major voluntary financial decisions.'
  },

      'A) Provide counseling to address the depression',
      'C) Suggest the client speak with a mental health professional',
      'B) Ignore the issue and focus on financial matters',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'CFP® professionals should recognize when issues exceed their expertise. Clinical depression requires mental health professionals. The planner should sensitively suggest professional help while continuing to support the client\'s financial needs within their scope.'
  },

      'C) Explore the client\'s own reasons for wanting change',
      'A) Present alarming statistics about retirement shortfalls',
      'B) Set up automatic savings without client involvement',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Motivational interviewing focuses on drawing out the client\'s own motivation rather than imposing external pressure. Exploring their reasons for change is more likely to create lasting behavior change than fear tactics or imposed solutions.'
  },
  {

      'B) Move on to a different topic',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Resistance often signals that the planner hasn\'t fully understood the client\'s situation or concerns. Exploring objections shows respect, builds trust, and often reveals important information that can lead to better recommendations.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,

      'B) Note the inconsistency and explore further',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'When verbal and nonverbal communication conflict, it warrants exploration. The planner should gently probe to understand the discrepancy: "I notice some hesitation—tell me more about your feelings on this." This ensures recommendations match the client\'s true comfort level.'

      'B) Promising high investment returns',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Trust is built primarily through reliability and follow-through. When planners do what they say they will do, clients develop confidence in the relationship. Promising high returns is unethical, and complexity/decor are superficial.'

      'B) Acknowledge the difficulty and allow a moment',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Empathetic response acknowledges the client\'s emotion without rushing past it or abandoning the conversation. A brief pause and acknowledgment ("This is understandably difficult") validates their feelings while maintaining a professional relationship.'

      'B) Endowment effect',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The endowment effect causes people to value things they own more than equivalent things they don\'t own. This makes clients reluctant to sell or diversify concentrated positions, even when financially advisable.'

      'C) Representativeness',
      'B) Availability bias',

    explanation: 'Prospect theory, developed by Kahneman and Tversky, found that losses are felt approximately twice as strongly as equivalent gains. This asymmetry explains loss aversion and why people often make decisions that seem irrational from traditional economic perspectives.'
