      'A) Ignoring client emotions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,

    subtopic: 'Transference',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'In financial planning, transference occurs when:',
    options: [
      'C) Advisers transfer clients to colleagues',
      'D) Recommendations are transferred in writing',
      'B) Clients unconsciously redirect feelings from past relationships onto their financial planner',
      'A) Clients transfer money between accounts',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Transference is a psychological phenomenon where clients project feelings (positive or negative) from other relationships—parents, authority figures—onto their adviser. Recognizing transference helps advisers maintain appropriate boundaries and understand why clients may react unexpectedly to advice or situations.'

    subtopic: 'Life Transitions',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Major life transitions often affect financial planning because:',
    options: [
      'C) Clients always make good decisions during transitions',
      'D) Transitions are always expected',
      'B) Events like divorce, job loss, inheritance, or diagnosis can trigger emotional responses that affect decision-making and planning needs',
      'A) They never impact finances',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Life transitions (marriage, divorce, death, retirement, health crisis) create both practical planning needs and emotional impacts. Clients may be overwhelmed, grieving, or anxious—affecting their decision-making. Advisers should recognize transition stages and adjust timing and approach accordingly.'

    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Herding',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Herding behavior in investing describes:',
    options: [
      'D) Dollar-cost averaging',
      'B) Following the crowd—buying what others are buying and selling when others sell—regardless of fundamentals',
      'C) Diversification strategies',
      'A) Long-term investing',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Herding leads investors to join market manias (buying at peaks) and panic selling (selling at bottoms). Social proof—others are doing it—overrides independent analysis. It contributes to bubbles and crashes. Advisers help clients resist herding by emphasizing long-term plans and fundamental value.'

    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Sunk Cost Fallacy',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The sunk cost fallacy causes investors to:',
    options: [
      'D) Over-diversify',
      'B) Hold losing positions because of the amount already invested, even when selling would be the best decision',
      'C) Ignore past performance',
      'A) Only invest in bonds',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Sunk costs are irrecoverable regardless of future decisions. The fallacy leads to throwing good money after bad—holding losers hoping to "get back to even." Rational decisions should consider only future costs and benefits. Advisers help clients focus on current prospects, not past investment amounts.'

    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Availability Heuristic',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The availability heuristic affects investing when:',
    options: [
      'B) Investors overweight information that is easily recalled—often recent, vivid, or frequently covered events',
      'D) Statistical analysis guides decisions',
      'C) Historical data is prioritized',
      'A) All information is equally weighted',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Availability bias leads to overestimating probabilities of memorable events. A recent market crash feels more likely to repeat. Dramatic company failures loom larger than statistics suggest. Media coverage amplifies this. Advisers counter with historical data and probability analysis.'

    id: 'cfp-psy-b5-007',

    topic: 'Communication',
    subtopic: 'Framing Effects',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Framing effects in presenting financial information mean:',
    options: [
      'B) How information is presented (gains vs. losses, percentages vs. dollars) affects perception and decisions even when facts are identical',
      'C) Using picture frames in offices',
      'D) Only numerical presentation matters',
      'A) The frame around a presentation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Framing profoundly affects decisions. "10% chance of loss" feels different than "90% chance of no loss." "$50,000 saved" creates different reactions than "only $50,000." Advisers can use framing ethically to present information clearly, but must not manipulate through misleading frames.'

    topic: 'Communication',
    subtopic: 'Motivational Interviewing',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Motivational interviewing techniques help advisers:',
    options: [
      'C) Enforce compliance',
      'B) Elicit clients\' own motivations for change through open questions, affirmations, reflections, and summaries',
      'D) Avoid discussing behavior change',
      'A) Lecture clients about proper behavior',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Motivational interviewing uses OARS: Open questions, Affirmations, Reflective listening, and Summary statements. It helps clients articulate their own reasons for change (more powerful than external pressure). Useful for behavior change like saving more or reducing debt—clients convince themselves rather than being told.'

    subtopic: 'Resistance',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When clients show resistance to financial recommendations:',
    options: [
      'D) Terminate the relationship',
      'C) Ignore the resistance',
      'B) Explore the underlying concerns through questions and listening, as resistance often signals unaddressed issues',
      'A) Push harder to convince them',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Resistance is information. It may indicate misunderstanding, fear, conflicting values, or past experiences. Rather than pushing through, rolling with resistance—exploring concerns, validating feelings, and addressing underlying issues—builds trust and often resolves objections more effectively.'

    topic: 'Client Psychology',
    subtopic: 'Money Scripts',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Money scripts are:',
    options: [
      'B) Unconscious beliefs about money often formed in childhood that influence financial behaviors and attitudes',
      'C) Budgeting spreadsheets',
      'D) Investment instructions',
      'A) Written financial plans',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Money scripts are deeply held beliefs (e.g., "Money is evil," "More money will solve all problems," "I don\'t deserve money"). Categories include avoidance, worship, status, and vigilance. Understanding clients\' money scripts helps explain seemingly irrational behaviors and guides productive conversations.'

    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Hindsight Bias',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Hindsight bias leads investors to:',
    options: [
      'C) Ignore past performance',
      'D) Make better decisions',
      'B) Believe past events were predictable after they occurred, leading to overconfidence in predicting future events',
      'A) Better predict future events',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Hindsight bias ("I knew it all along") distorts memory—past surprises seem obvious in retrospect. This creates overconfidence in predicting future events. Investors who "knew" the 2008 crash was coming believe they can predict the next one. Advisers should document predictions to counter this bias.'

    question: 'Building rapport with clients includes:',
    options: [
      'D) Maintaining strict formality at all times',
      'C) Only discussing finances',
      'B) Finding common ground, showing genuine interest, using appropriate body language, and establishing trust before diving into technical matters',
      'A) Immediately discussing portfolio returns',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Rapport creates trust and openness. Techniques include mirroring body language, finding shared interests, remembering personal details, using active listening, and showing genuine care. Strong rapport improves information gathering, enhances receptiveness to advice, and builds lasting relationships.'

    subtopic: 'Financial Anxiety',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When working with financially anxious clients:',
    options: [
      'D) Avoid discussing their concerns',
      'C) Overwhelm them with data to prove they\'re wrong',
      'B) Acknowledge their feelings, provide clear information, create structure through plans, and avoid information overload',
      'A) Dismiss their concerns as irrational',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Financial anxiety is common and valid. Acknowledge feelings without judgment. Break complex decisions into smaller steps. Provide clear, simple information. Create plans that offer sense of control. Avoid jargon and overwhelming detail. Regular check-ins can prevent anxiety from escalating.'

    subtopic: 'Endowment Effect',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'The endowment effect causes people to:',
    options: [
      'B) Overvalue things they own compared to identical things they don\'t own',
      'D) Trade frequently',
      'C) Undervalue possessions',
      'A) Value charitable endowments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'People value what they own more than identical items they don\'t own. This leads to holding investments (especially inherited or long-held assets) beyond rational analysis. Clients may resist selling concentrated stock positions or inherited property despite risk reduction benefits.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When working with couples who disagree about financial matters:',
    options: [
      'B) Facilitate discussion, ensure both voices are heard, identify shared goals, and help find compromise solutions',
      'D) Refuse to work with couples',
      'C) Meet only with one partner',
      'A) Side with the person who makes more money',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Couples often have different money attitudes, risk tolerances, and goals. Neutral facilitation helps: ensure quieter partners speak, identify common ground, reframe conflict as different perspectives rather than right/wrong. Joint meetings are generally preferred unless circumstances indicate otherwise.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When clients experience financial loss or death of a spouse, understanding grief stages:',
    options: [
      'C) Means delaying all financial decisions indefinitely',
      'B) Helps advisers recognize that clients may cycle through denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—affecting decision-making',
      'D) Requires professional therapy certification',
      'A) Is irrelevant to financial planning',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Grief (whether from death, divorce, job loss, or market losses) affects cognition and decision-making. Stages aren\'t linear—clients may cycle through them. Major decisions are often best delayed during acute grief. Advisers should recognize grief\'s impact while knowing when to refer to mental health professionals.'

    subtopic: 'Representativeness',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The representativeness heuristic leads investors to:',
    options: [
      'C) Focus on diversification',
      'B) Judge probability based on how similar something is to a stereotype, ignoring base rates and sample sizes',
      'D) Conduct thorough research',
      'A) Properly evaluate probabilities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Representativeness bias judges likelihood based on stereotypes. A company that "looks like" a successful tech firm may be judged likely to succeed regardless of fundamentals. Small samples that "look random" may be trusted. This leads to pattern-seeking in random data and ignoring statistical reality.'

    topic: 'Communication',
    subtopic: 'Empathy vs Sympathy',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Showing empathy rather than sympathy means:',
    options: [
      'B) Understanding and sharing the client\'s feelings from their perspective rather than just expressing pity',
      'C) Maintaining distance from clients',
      'D) Solving their problems immediately',
      'A) Feeling sorry for clients',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Sympathy is feeling sorry for someone; empathy is understanding their experience from their viewpoint. Empathy ("I understand this is frightening") connects; sympathy ("That\'s too bad") can create distance. Empathetic responses validate feelings and build trust without necessarily agreeing.'

    question: 'Financial therapy integrates:',
    options: [
      'C) Only psychological counseling',
      'D) Tax planning only',
      'B) Cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and relational aspects of financial well-being with traditional financial planning',
      'A) Only investment advice',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Financial therapy addresses the emotional and behavioral aspects of money—not just numbers. It recognizes that financial behaviors are influenced by beliefs, emotions, and relationships. CFP® professionals may use financial therapy techniques while knowing when to refer to licensed therapists for clinical issues.'

    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Outcome Bias',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Outcome bias causes people to:',
    options: [
      'C) Ignore past outcomes',
      'B) Judge decisions based on results rather than the quality of the decision-making process at the time',
      'D) Make better decisions',
      'A) Focus on process quality',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Outcome bias judges decisions by results, not process. A risky decision that happened to work is viewed as "good"; a sound decision with bad luck is "bad." This reinforces poor decision-making and discourages good process. Advisers should evaluate decisions based on information available at the time.'

    subtopic: 'Summarizing',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Summarizing during client meetings:',
    options: [
      'D) Is only for written communication',
      'C) Should only happen at year-end',
      'B) Ensures understanding, shows clients they\'ve been heard, and crystallizes key points for decisions',
      'A) Is a waste of time',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Summarizing throughout meetings—not just at the end—confirms understanding, demonstrates active listening, and gives clients opportunity to correct misunderstandings. "Let me make sure I understand: you want to retire at 60, maintain your lifestyle, and leave money to grandchildren. Is that right?"'

    subtopic: 'Fear and Greed',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Managing clients\' fear and greed during market extremes requires:',
    options: [
      'C) Making trades quickly to reduce anxiety',
      'D) Ignoring their emotions',
      'B) Reminding clients of their long-term goals, the role of their plan, and historical perspective while validating their feelings',
      'A) Matching their emotional response',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Fear (market bottoms) and greed (market tops) drive destructive behavior. Acknowledge emotions—they\'re natural. Refocus on the plan created during rational times. Use historical context carefully (not dismissively). Sometimes practical steps (rebalancing, stress testing) provide sense of action without abandoning strategy.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Behavioral interventions to help clients with self-control include:',
    options: [
      'B) Automation (auto-save), commitment devices (penalties for withdrawal), and pre-commitment strategies',
      'D) Avoiding the topic',
      'C) Punishment for failures',
      'A) Relying solely on willpower',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Self-control is limited; systems beat willpower. Automation removes decisions (automatic savings). Commitment devices add friction to impulsive actions (early withdrawal penalties, investment policy statements). Mental accounting (separate accounts for goals) can help even if economically irrational.'

    options: [
      'D) Only working within your own culture',
      'B) Understanding how cultural backgrounds may influence financial attitudes, family structures, and decision-making styles',
      'C) Avoiding diverse clients',
      'A) Applying one approach to all clients',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Culture affects attitudes toward debt, family financial obligations, risk, gender roles in finances, and comfort with financial discussions. Culturally competent advisers ask about preferences rather than assume, recognize their own cultural biases, and adapt communication and recommendations accordingly.'

    question: 'When working with aging clients, signs of potential cognitive decline that warrant attention include:',
    options: [
      'D) Wanting to change investment strategy',
      'B) Pattern changes like repeated questions, unusual transactions, confusion about holdings, or personality changes',
      'C) Disagreeing with recommendations',
      'A) Forgetting one appointment',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Red flags include: repeated identical questions, inability to understand previously-understood concepts, unusual transaction requests, uncharacteristic financial decisions, or new influential third parties. Having a trusted contact on file helps. Advisers must balance client autonomy with protection, documenting concerns and knowing when to escalate.'
