    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Hyperbolic Discounting',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Hyperbolic discounting leads clients to:',
    options: [
      'D) Avoid all spending',
      'C) Save too much',
      'A) Overvalue long-term rewards',
      'B) Disproportionately prefer immediate rewards over larger future rewards, explaining undersaving and debt accumulation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Hyperbolic discounting: people heavily discount future rewards compared to immediate ones, but the discount rate decreases for distant time horizons. This leads to present bias (preferring $100 today over $120 next month, but indifference between $100 in 12 months vs $120 in 13 months). Explains procrastination, undersaving, and credit card debt.'

    subtopic: 'Self-Control Problems',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Commitment devices help clients with self-control by:',
    options: [
      'A) Removing all choices',
      'C) Requiring spouse approval',
      'D) Limiting investment options',
      'B) Creating structures that make it harder to deviate from plans, like automatic savings or penalty clauses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Commitment devices lock in future behavior when willpower might fail. Examples: automatic 401(k) contributions (saves before spending), Roth conversion in low-income years (committed tax strategy), irrevocable trusts (cannot reclaim assets), penalty for early withdrawal (deters impulsive access). Clients often appreciate these guardrails.'

    options: [
      'A) Ignore all information',
      'C) Only read financial news',
      'D) Prefer bonds over stocks',
      'B) Create coherent stories to explain random market movements, finding patterns where none exist',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Narrative fallacy: our need to construct stories leads to finding causality in random events. After market drops, we create explanations ("trade tensions caused the sell-off") that may be coincidental. This false sense of understanding breeds overconfidence about predicting future movements. Markets are often more random than narratives suggest.'

    topic: 'Communication',
    subtopic: 'Active Constructive Responding',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When a client shares positive news like a promotion, active constructive responding involves:',
    options: [
      'C) Pointing out potential downsides',
      'A) Quickly changing the topic',
      'D) Briefly acknowledging it',
      'B) Enthusiastically engaging, asking follow-up questions, and helping them savor the positive experience',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Active constructive responding (from positive psychology): respond to good news with enthusiasm and curiosity—ask questions, express joy, help them relive the experience. This builds relationship and trust. Passive or destructive responses (dismissing, undermining, focusing on negatives) damage rapport. Key to client relationship building.'

    topic: 'Communication',
    subtopic: 'Difficult Conversations',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When delivering difficult financial news, a planner should:',
    options: [
      'D) Minimize the problem',
      'A) Avoid the topic entirely',
      'C) Deliver information only via email',
      'B) Communicate directly but empathetically, allow space for emotional response, and provide actionable next steps',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Difficult conversations (job loss affecting plan, unrealistic goals, portfolio losses): be direct but compassionate, validate emotions, pause for response, then focus on actionable next steps. Avoiding or sugar-coating erodes trust. Written follow-up helps with information retention when stress impairs processing.'

    topic: 'Communication',
    subtopic: 'Shared Decision Making',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Shared decision-making in financial planning means:',
    options: [
      'A) The planner makes all decisions',
      'D) Following industry benchmarks',
      'C) Clients decide without guidance',
      'B) Collaboratively developing recommendations with clients, incorporating their values, preferences, and informed input',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Shared decision-making: planner brings expertise, client brings values and preferences, decisions made together. Present options clearly, explain trade-offs, ensure understanding, let client choose. This improves satisfaction and adherence—clients "own" their plan rather than following orders. Medical field research shows better outcomes.'

    id: 'cfp-psy-b6-007',
    courseId: 'cfp',

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client with high financial anxiety should be approached by:',
    options: [
      'A) Dismissing their concerns as irrational',
      'D) Recommending only cash investments',
      'C) Showing worst-case scenarios',
      'B) Validating feelings, providing clear information, focusing on what\'s controllable, and building confidence gradually',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Financial anxiety: validate their experience (it\'s real), provide clear information to counter uncertainty, focus on controllable actions, build confidence through small wins. Avoid overwhelming with data or dismissing concerns. Creating sense of control and progress reduces anxiety. Consider if therapy referral is appropriate for severe cases.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A client who grew up in poverty and now earns a high income may:',
    options: [
      'D) Only invest in real estate',
      'C) Never save money',
      'A) Automatically become a confident investor',
      'B) Hold deep-seated fears about money loss, oscillate between extreme saving and spending, or feel undeserving of wealth',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Childhood financial trauma creates lasting patterns: scarcity mindset (hoarding, extreme anxiety about spending), guilt about having more than family of origin, alternating between restriction and splurging, difficulty trusting stability. Understanding their history enables compassionate guidance and realistic expectations for behavior change.'

    options: [
      'D) Contacting the recipients directly',
      'C) Refusing to manage their accounts',
      'A) Ignoring it',
      'B) Helping clients recognize the pattern, understand its impact, and develop healthier alternatives if they choose',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Financial enabling: giving money that perpetuates dependency (adult children never becoming independent, rescuing repeatedly from consequences). Approach: raise awareness without judgment, explore motivations (guilt, love, control), discuss long-term impacts, offer alternatives (matching gifts for savings, paying for education not lifestyle). Client must choose any changes.'

    id: 'cfp-psy-b6-010',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-PSY',

    topic: 'Client Assessment',
    subtopic: 'Life Transitions Assessment',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A comprehensive assessment of clients in life transitions should include:',
    options: [
      'C) Investment preferences only',
      'D) Previous advisor relationships',
      'A) Only financial data',
      'B) Financial situation, emotional readiness, social support systems, and timeline flexibility',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Life transitions (divorce, retirement, inheritance, widowhood) require holistic assessment: financial situation (immediate and long-term needs), emotional state (decision-making capacity may be compromised), support systems (who else is helping), timeline (what decisions can wait). Rushing major decisions during stress leads to regrets.'

    subtopic: 'Questionnaire Limitations',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Standardized risk tolerance questionnaires have limitations including:',
    options: [
      'D) They only work for young clients',
      'C) They are never used',
      'A) They are too accurate',
      'B) Responses may vary with market conditions, not capture emotional reactions, and fail to distinguish risk tolerance from risk capacity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Questionnaire limitations: answers change based on recent market performance (recency bias), hypothetical scenarios don\'t capture actual emotional responses, conflate tolerance (psychological) with capacity (financial ability), and may not probe deeply enough. Use as starting point, not definitive answer—follow up with discussion and observe behavior over time.'

    subtopic: 'Values Clarification',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Values clarification exercises help planners:',
    options: [
      'C) Sell more products',
      'A) Impose their own values',
      'D) Reduce meeting time',
      'B) Understand what matters most to clients, enabling aligned recommendations and improved plan adherence',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Values clarification: through exercises, cards, or discussion, help clients articulate what they truly value (security, experiences, legacy, independence). Recommendations aligned with values feel right and get followed. Misaligned recommendations create resistance. Values also help prioritize when trade-offs are necessary.'

    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Regret Aversion',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Regret aversion affects investment decisions by:',
    options: [
      'C) Improving diversification',
      'A) Encouraging more risk-taking',
      'D) Focusing on fundamentals',
      'B) Making people avoid actions that might lead to regret, often resulting in inaction or conventional choices',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Regret aversion: fear of making decisions we\'ll regret leads to inaction (staying in cash) or conventional choices (buying popular investments "at least I won\'t be alone"). Anticipated regret for action is often stronger than for inaction. Counter by framing inaction as a choice and discussing regret of missed opportunities.'

    section: 'CFP-PSY',
    blueprintArea: 'PSY-2',
    topic: 'Communication',
    subtopic: 'Cultural Dimensions',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Hofstede\'s cultural dimension of "individualism vs. collectivism" affects financial planning because:',
    options: [
      'A) It only affects savings rates',
      'D) It determines risk tolerance',
      'C) Individualist clients never save',
      'B) Collectivist clients may prioritize family obligations, share decision-making, and expect to support extended family',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Individualistic cultures: personal goals, individual achievement, nuclear family focus. Collectivist cultures: group identity, extended family obligations, shared resources and decisions. Planners must understand which orientation applies—a collectivist client\'s "estate plan" may center on lifelong support of extended family, not just spouse and children.'

    subtopic: 'Financial Infidelity',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When uncovering financial infidelity (hidden accounts, debt, or spending) between spouses:',
    options: [
      'A) Report it to the deceived spouse immediately',
      'D) End the client relationship',
      'C) Ignore it if amounts are small',
      'B) Maintain confidentiality with your client, encourage honest communication, and consider if the engagement can continue',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Financial secrets between spouses create ethical challenges. Generally, maintain confidentiality with your client (the one who shared information), but encourage honest communication and explain how secrets undermine planning. Consider: who is actually the client? Can you effectively serve both? You may need to withdraw if serving separate interests becomes untenable.'

    topic: 'Client Assessment',
    subtopic: 'Behavioral Segmentation',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Behavioral segmentation of clients (e.g., avoiders, planners, spontaneous) helps planners:',
    options: [
      'D) Eliminate difficult clients',
      'A) Standardize all recommendations',
      'C) Charge different fees',
      'B) Tailor communication style, meeting frequency, and accountability structures to each client\'s natural tendencies',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Behavioral types respond to different approaches. Avoiders: need structured accountability and simple next steps. Planners: appreciate detailed analysis and control. Spontaneous: need guardrails and commitment devices. Matching your approach to their style improves engagement and outcomes. One-size-fits-all planning ignores psychological differences.'

    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Peak-End Rule',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The peak-end rule suggests that clients\' memory of an experience is most influenced by:',
    options: [
      'D) The duration of the experience',
      'C) The average experience',
      'A) The first and last moments only',
      'B) The most intense moment (positive or negative) and how the experience ended',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Peak-end rule (Kahneman): memories of experiences are dominated by the peak intensity and ending, not duration or average. For planning: end meetings on positive notes, ensure peak moments are positive (not anxious), and manage difficult conversations to end constructively. A great meeting can be remembered poorly if it ends badly.'

    subtopic: 'Silence',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The strategic use of silence in client meetings:',
    options: [
      'C) Shows disinterest',
      'D) Only works with introverts',
      'A) Should be avoided as awkward',
      'B) Gives clients space to think, process emotions, and share more than they might with continuous questioning',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Silence is a powerful communication tool. After asking a meaningful question or sharing information, pause—resist filling the space. Clients often share more when given time to think. Silence after emotional moments shows respect and patience. Many planners talk too much; learning to be comfortable with silence improves client engagement.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Clients experiencing sudden wealth (lottery, IPO, inheritance) often need:',
    options: [
      'A) Immediate investment of all funds',
      'C) Complete financial overhaul immediately',
      'D) Higher risk investments',
      'B) Time to adjust psychologically, education on new responsibilities, and protection from hasty decisions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Sudden wealth syndrome: psychological adjustment takes time. Many feel guilty, confused, or pressured by others. Recommendations: park funds safely initially, avoid major decisions for 6-12 months, protect privacy, educate on new concerns (estate planning, tax), guard against others\' expectations. Many sudden-wealth recipients lose it quickly due to poor decisions.'

    subtopic: 'Financial Socialization',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'A client who grew up in a household where money was never discussed openly tends to avoid financial conversations with their spouse. This pattern is BEST explained by:',
    options: [
      'Cognitive dissonance in financial decision-making',
      'The influence of financial socialization and money scripts developed in childhood',
      'Overconfidence bias in personal finance',
      'The anchoring effect on investment decisions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Financial socialization shapes attitudes toward money through family, culture, and early experiences. Money scripts — unconscious beliefs about money developed in childhood — influence adult financial behaviors. A family where money was taboo may produce avoidance patterns in adult financial discussions.',

    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Information Overload',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Information overload leads to:',
    options: [
      'A) Better decisions',
      'C) More diversification',
      'D) Higher returns',
      'B) Decision paralysis, reliance on shortcuts, and potentially worse choices despite more information',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Too much information paradoxically impairs decision-making. People become paralyzed or use simple heuristics (defaults, familiar options) rather than analyzing all data. Planners should curate information, present key factors clearly, and avoid overwhelming clients with every available option or data point. Simplify without oversimplifying.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When explaining probabilistic outcomes (e.g., Monte Carlo results) to clients:',
    options: [
      'A) Only show point estimates',
      'C) Avoid all numbers',
      'D) Focus only on worst case',
      'B) Use multiple formats (percentages, frequencies, visual displays) and check understanding, as probability concepts are often misunderstood',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Probability communication is challenging—people misunderstand percentages and interpret them through biases. Best practices: use natural frequencies ("80 out of 100") alongside percentages, provide visual representations, give context (compared to what?), and actively check understanding. "85% success probability" means different things to different people.'

      'D) Investment returns',
      'B) Sense of security, freedom to make choices, and being on track to meet future goals, not just wealth level',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Financial wellbeing (CFPB definition): security and freedom—control over day-to-day finances, capacity to absorb shocks, on track for long-term goals, and freedom to make choices to enjoy life. High income/wealth doesn\'t guarantee wellbeing; moderate wealth with security and values-alignment can produce greater wellbeing.'

      'C) Just income levels',
      'B) Financial knowledge/skills AND the ability to act on them, including psychological factors and access to appropriate products',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Financial capability = knowledge/skills + psychological ability to act + access to resources. Someone may understand investing but be paralyzed by anxiety. Another may be motivated but lack knowledge. A third may have both but lack access to appropriate products. Effective planning addresses all three elements to improve capability.'

    options: [
      'A) People ignore others\'s behavior',

      'C) Only in group settings',
      'B) People look to others\' actions for guidance on what to do, especially under uncertainty',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Social proof: we follow others\' behavior especially when uncertain. "Everyone is buying crypto" or "my neighbor got a reverse mortgage" influences decisions. Can be positive (using peer retirement savings benchmarks) or negative (herd behavior causing bubbles). Planners can harness social proof ("many clients in your situation...") ethically.'
