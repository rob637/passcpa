    topic: 'Behavioral Finance',
    subtopic: 'Sunk Cost Fallacy',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'When a client refuses to sell a losing investment because they\'ve "already put so much into it," they are exhibiting:',
    options: [
      'B) Sunk cost fallacy, where past unrecoverable costs inappropriately influence current decisions',
      'D) Risk aversion',
      'A) Rational analysis',
      'C) Effective tax planning',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Sunk cost fallacy: letting irrecoverable past costs influence future decisions. Money already lost shouldn\'t affect whether to sell now—only future prospects matter. Common with losing investments, ongoing projects, or bad relationships. Help clients focus on: "What\'s the best use of this money going forward?" Past is irrelevant.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'After receiving an inheritance, a conservative investor suddenly takes aggressive risks. This demonstrates:',
    options: [
      'B) House money effect, where gains are treated as less valuable "house money" that can be risked',
      'D) Goal-based investing',
      'A) Improved financial sophistication',
      'C) Proper diversification',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'House money effect (from gambling): treating gains/windfalls differently than earned money. "It\'s not my money anyway." Leads to excessive risk-taking with inheritances, bonuses, investment gains. Money is fungible—all dollars should be valued equally. Help clients integrate windfalls into overall financial plan rather than treating them as play money.'

    difficulty: 'easy',

    question: 'Status quo bias explains why clients:',
    options: [
      'A) Always optimize their portfolios',
      'D) Ignore all advice',
      'B) Prefer current arrangements and resist changing even when alternatives are objectively better',
      'C) Take excessive risks',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Status quo bias: preference for current state over change. "I\'ve always done it this way." Keeps people in unsuitable investments, with wrong insurance, at the same bank. Change requires effort and feels risky. Use defaults wisely (auto-enrollment exploits this positively). Demonstrate clear benefit to overcome inertia.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Judging an investment decision as good solely because it made money demonstrates:',
    options: [
      'A) Sound analysis',
      'D) Hindsight effectiveness',
      'B) Outcome bias, which evaluates decisions by results rather than the quality of the decision process',
      'C) Returns-based investing',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Outcome bias: judging decisions by results rather than process. A risky bet that pays off was still a bad decision if the odds were against it. Good process can have bad outcomes; bad process can luckily succeed. Evaluate: was the decision reasonable given information available at the time? Focus on quality process, not hindsight.'

      'C) Criticizing current behaviors',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Motivational interviewing: client-centered approach. Express empathy, develop discrepancy between goals and behavior, roll with resistance (don\'t argue), support self-efficacy.

      'D) Agreeing with everything',
      'C) Taking extensive notes only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Active listening: full attention, suspend judgment, use nonverbal cues (eye contact, nodding), reflect back what you hear, ask clarifying questions, remember details.

      'C) Shows weakness',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Empathy statements: "I understand this is frustrating," "It makes sense you\'re worried." Validates feelings without necessarily agreeing. Builds rapport and trust. Especially important during market downturns, life changes, or difficult news. Doesn\'t mean agreeing—clients can be heard without being right. Creates psychological safety.'

      'C) Investment strategies',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Money scripts (Klontz): unconscious beliefs from childhood experiences/family messages. Categories: avoidance ("money is bad"), worship ("more money solves everything"), status ("success = possessions"), vigilance ("saving above all"). Scripts drive behavior without awareness. Identifying them helps understand client decisions and resistance to advice.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Financial anxiety management: acknowledge the anxiety is real, start with small manageable tasks, avoid overwhelming with information, celebrate progress, use simple clear language, provide reassurance about the process.

      'B) Combine questionnaires with conversations about past experiences, current feelings, and hypothetical scenarios',
      'A) Use only questionnaires',
      'C) Rely on age alone',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Comprehensive risk assessment: questionnaires (standardized comparison), conversation (past behavior, emotional responses, understanding), hypothetical scenarios ("how would you feel if the portfolio dropped 30%"), observe behavior during volatile periods. One method isn\'t enough. Revisit when circumstances change. Risk tolerance vs. risk capacity differ.'

      'B) Different life stages bring different priorities, concerns, capabilities, and time horizons',
      'A) Everyone in the same age group is identical',
      'C) Only retirement matters',

      'B) Tailor communication style, set appropriate expectations, and design strategies they\'ll actually follow',
      'C) Determine their intelligence',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,

      'The sunk cost fallacy and general risk aversion',
      'The endowment effect combined with sentimental attachment',
      'Herding behavior in financial markets',
    ],

      'D) Only invest in index funds',
      'C) Avoid all stocks',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Familiarity bias: preferring the known over unknown.

      'D) Minimize the problem',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Difficult conversations: prepare what you\'ll say, be honest but compassionate, allow time for reaction, don\'t defend or make excuses, acknowledge feelings ("I know this is hard to hear"), pivot to solutions and next steps when ready. Avoiding bad news erodes trust. Delivering it well builds trust even when news is negative.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Nonverbal communication: body language, facial expressions, tone, posture.

    explanation: 'Knowledge assessment: understand baseline to communicate appropriately. Some clients have sophisticated knowledge; others are beginners.

      'A) Make better decisions',
      'C) Always pick the best option',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Choice overload (paradox of choice): too many options leads to paralysis, worse decisions, or choosing defaults/doing nothing. In 401(k)s, too many funds reduces participation. Planners help by: curating options, providing clear recommendations, simplifying where possible. Guidance through choices adds value beyond just presenting options.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Storytelling in planning: abstract concepts become tangible. "Inflation means what costs $1 today will cost $2.40 in 30 years." Anonymized examples: "I worked with a couple in similar situation who..." Stories are memorable and relatable. Use appropriately—support, don\'t replace, data. Powerful teaching and persuasion tool.'

    explanation: 'Delayed gratification challenges: future self feels abstract. Strategies: visualize future goals concretely, use photos of older self, automate savings (pre-commitment), create mental accounting for future, balance—allow some present enjoyment.

Recommend, don\'t dictate.'
