    topic: 'Needs Analysis',
    subtopic: 'Replacement Ratio',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The replacement ratio approach to retirement planning assumes:',
    options: [
      'C) Doubling retirement income',
      'D) No inflation adjustment',
      'B) A target percentage of pre-retirement income will maintain lifestyle, typically 70-80% due to reduced expenses',
      'A) Keeping income exactly the same',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Replacement ratio: target percentage of pre-retirement income (commonly 70-80%). Lower needed because: no longer saving for retirement, reduced taxes, no work expenses, potentially no mortgage. May underestimate: healthcare costs, travel in early retirement. Best as starting point—detailed expense analysis is more accurate for individual planning.'

    question: 'A capital preservation approach to retirement income:',
    options: [
      'D) Ignores inflation',
      'C) Requires annuitization',
      'B) Maintains the principal value of assets while spending only investment returns',
      'A) Spends down all assets during retirement',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Capital preservation: live on investment earnings, preserve principal. Benefits: assets to leave heirs, cushion for longevity, psychological security. Drawbacks: requires larger portfolio, may underspend in retirement. Alternative: capital utilization (planned spending of principal). Choice depends on goals—legacy vs. maximizing retirement lifestyle.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'What is the PRIMARY advantage of using Monte Carlo simulation over a deterministic (straight-line) projection in retirement planning?',
    options: [
      'Monte Carlo simulations always produce more optimistic results',
      'Monte Carlo simulations account for the sequence of returns risk and market volatility by running thousands of randomized scenarios',
      'Monte Carlo simulations eliminate the need for estimating expected returns',
      'Monte Carlo simulations use only historical returns and cannot incorporate future assumptions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Monte Carlo simulation generates thousands of randomized return scenarios to model the probability of portfolio success, capturing the impact of return volatility and sequence of returns risk. Deterministic projections assume a constant return rate and cannot show the range of possible outcomes.',

      'B) Bypass ADP/ACP nondiscrimination testing by making specified contribution formulas immediately vested',
      'C) Reduce employee benefits',
      'D) Exclude certain employees',
      'A) Avoid all contributions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Safe Harbor 401(k): avoid nondiscrimination testing (ADP/ACP) by providing: 3% nonelective contribution to all eligible OR 4% matching (100% first 3% + 50% next 2%). Must be immediately 100% vested. Provides certainty for HCEs about contribution limits. Trade-off: guaranteed cost vs. testing risk.'

      'B) Allows larger allocations to older employees because they have less time for compound growth',
      'C) Requires equal dollar contributions',
      'D) Is always prohibited',
      'A) Favors younger employees',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Age-weighted profit sharing: allocates considering age/time to retirement. Older employees receive larger current contributions because less time for compound growth. Must still pass nondiscrimination testing (cross-testing). Useful when owners/key employees are older than staff. New comparability/cross-tested plans are related approach for flexibility.'

      'A) Are always penalty-free',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Hardship withdrawals: limited to employee elective deferrals, must be for immediate/heavy need (medical, eviction, funeral, certain education), taxable as ordinary income, 10% penalty applies unless exception, cannot exceed need. Not loans—cannot be repaid. Last resort after other resources exhausted. Plan must allow.'

      'C) Avoiding all taxes',
      'A) Rolling all assets to an IRA',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'NUA: distribute employer stock in-kind rather than rolling to IRA. Pay ordinary income on cost basis at distribution. NUA (growth in plan) taxed as LTCG when stock sold. Benefits: LTCG rates vs. ordinary rates, no 10-year rule for heirs. Requirements: lump-sum distribution, must be employer securities. Analyze: enough NUA to make worthwhile?'

      'A) Take distributions over their lifetime',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'SECURE Act changed inherited IRA rules: most non-spouse beneficiaries subject to 10-year rule (account emptied by 12/31 of year containing 10th anniversary). No annual RMDs for most. Exceptions (EDBs): surviving spouse, minor children (until majority), disabled/chronically ill, those not more than 10 years younger.

      '50% of the account balance up to a maximum of $500,000',
      'There is no dollar limit on QLAC purchases',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The SECURE Act 2.0 eliminated the 25% limit and set the QLAC maximum at $200,000 (indexed for inflation). QLAC assets are excluded from RMD calculations until the annuity start date (no later than age 85), helping manage longevity risk and reduce early RMD amounts.',

      'C) The amount after early claiming reduction',
      'B) The benefit payable at full retirement age, calculated from the Average Indexed Monthly Earnings',
      'D) Annual earnings',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'PIA: monthly benefit at Full Retirement Age (FRA). Calculated from AIME using bend points formula (progressive—replaces higher percentage of lower earnings). Early claiming reduces PIA; delayed claiming increases it. Knowing PIA helps calculate benefits at different ages. Based on highest 35 years of indexed earnings.'

    options: [
      'A) Both claiming at 62',
      'C) Always delaying both to 70',
      'B) Considering which spouse has higher earnings, survivor benefits, age difference, and life expectancy',
      'D) Ignoring the other spouse\'s benefits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Couple claiming strategy: higher earner delay (maximizes survivor benefit for longer-living spouse), lower earner may claim earlier (provides income while waiting), age difference matters (survivor benefits), relative health/life expectancy, break-even analysis. Survivor benefit = higher of own or deceased spouse\'s. Maximize lifetime household benefit, not individual.'

      'C) Increases total benefits',
      'A) Still allows full strategic use',
      'B) Is largely eliminated—suspending benefits now also suspends auxiliary benefits for spouse',
      'D) Works exactly as before 2015',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 eliminated most file-and-suspend strategies. Now if worker suspends, spouse also has benefits suspended. Can still suspend for delayed retirement credits, but doesn\'t enable spousal benefits while worker delays. Existing strategies grandfathered if filed before April 29, 2016. Know current rules vs. historical.'

    options: [
      'B) Matches assets to specific future liabilities/spending needs, often using bonds to fund near-term expenses',
      'C) Ignores spending patterns',
      'A) Focuses only on equity returns',
      'D) Recommends 100% stocks',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Liability-driven investing (LDI): structure assets to meet specific future liabilities. Time-segment (bucket) approach: near-term (0-5 years) in conservative assets, mid-term in balanced, long-term in growth. Essential expenses may be covered by guaranteed income (annuities, pensions, SS). Match durations. Reduces sequence-of-returns risk for near-term needs.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A rising equity glide path in retirement:',
    options: [
      'C) Maintains fixed allocation',
      'B) Starts with lower equity exposure and increases it later if early sequence risk doesn\'t materialize',
      'A) Decreases stock allocation over time',
      'D) Ignores market conditions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Rising equity glide path: counter-intuitive but research-supported. Lower equity at retirement (vulnerable to sequence risk), increase over time. If early poor returns occur, portfolio is protected. If good early returns, later can take more risk with cushion. Historical analysis suggests may reduce failure rates. Contrasts with traditional declining glide path.'

      'C) Only age',
      'D) Only inflation'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Dynamic/guardrail strategies: adjust withdrawal rate based on portfolio performance. Example: if portfolio grows significantly, can increase spending; if declines significantly, reduce spending. Ceiling and floor guardrails prevent extremes. Better success rates than fixed withdrawal, but requires spending flexibility. Common: Guyton-Klinger, Kitces, and others.'

      'D) Only prescription drugs',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Healthcare in retirement: Medicare premiums (A, B, D—means-tested), Medigap or Advantage costs, dental/vision/hearing (not covered), prescription copays, long-term care (major gap), pre-65 coverage if retiring early. Estimates: couples may need $300K+ just for healthcare. Often underestimated—plan specifically for this major expense.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Defined benefit: promises specific retirement benefit (formula based on years of service x salary factor). Employer funds and invests, bears investment risk. PBGC insures private plans. Becoming rare—cost and risk shifted employers to DC plans. If offered, understand: vesting, formula, COLA, survivor options, lump sum vs. annuity choice.'

    question: 'A client has $200,000 in a traditional IRA (all pre-tax contributions) and $50,000 in a nondeductible IRA. They want to convert only the nondeductible IRA to a Roth IRA tax-free. Why is this not possible?',
    options: [
      'Nondeductible IRA contributions cannot be converted to Roth IRAs',
      'The pro-rata rule requires that conversions include a proportional mix of pre-tax and after-tax amounts across all traditional IRA accounts',
      'Only employer-sponsored plan accounts can be converted to Roth IRAs',
      'The IRS prohibits Roth conversions when total IRA balances exceed $200,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The pro-rata rule aggregates all traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRA balances when determining the taxable portion of a conversion. With $200,000 pre-tax and $50,000 after-tax ($250,000 total), 80% of any conversion is taxable. The client cannot selectively convert only the after-tax portion.',

      'C) Medicare only',
      'B) Retirement benefits at Full Retirement Age, with the same benefit amount',
      'D) Reduced benefits regardless',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'SSDI: automatically converts to retirement benefits at FRA at same amount. Medicare starts 24 months after SSDI begins (exception: ALS immediate). No reduction for early claiming—disability waives that. Important: SSDI recipients don\'t have to decide about early vs. delayed claiming. Disability benefit equals unreduced FRA amount.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: '403(b) and 457(b) plans have separate elective deferral limits, allowing participants in both to contribute the maximum to each.
