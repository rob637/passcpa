    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'The "go-go, slow-go, no-go" model of retirement spending describes:',
    options: [
      'B) Declining spending patterns where active early years have higher discretionary spending that decreases with age',
      'A) Investment strategies',
      'C) Social Security claiming',
      'D) Healthcare costs only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Retirement spending phases: Go-go (60s-70s): active, travel, hobbies—higher discretionary. Slow-go (mid-70s-80s): slower pace, less travel—lower discretionary. No-go (80s+): less active but possibly higher healthcare. Implications: may not need level inflation-adjusted spending; front-load experiences; plan for healthcare later. More realistic than straight-line assumptions.'

      'D) Social Security benefits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Funded ratio: Assets / PV(Liabilities). If 100%, fully funded. Under 100%, shortfall exists. Over 100%, surplus. Borrowed from pension accounting. Useful for: tracking progress, setting priorities, determining if can retire. Liabilities include: essential spending, discretionary goals. Can calculate total or category-by-category. More precise than simple net worth comparison.'

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Income source inventory: Social Security (estimate via SSA.gov), pensions/annuities (check statements), investment accounts (project sustainable withdrawals), rental income, part-time work (realistic?), inheritance expectations (uncertain), business value. Coordinate: which sources first, tax optimization, guaranteed vs. variable. Complete picture enables comprehensive planning.'

      'A) A defined contribution plan',
      'D) An IRA variant',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Cash balance: hybrid DB plan. Technically defined benefit (employer bears investment risk, PBGC covered), but looks like DC (individual account balance). Credits: pay credits (percentage of salary) + interest credits (guaranteed rate). Benefits: more portable than traditional DB, easier to understand. Still must follow DB rules—can be complex to administer. Growing in popularity.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: '457(b) advantage: no 10% early withdrawal penalty at any age. Still owe income tax, but no penalty. Unique among employer retirement plans.

      'A) Only interest paid',
      'D) Higher contribution limits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Plan loan opportunity cost: borrowed funds aren\'t invested (miss potential gains), repayments with after-tax dollars (taxed again at distribution), job change risk (may require immediate repayment or deemed distribution). Not as "free" as appears. Sometimes necessary, but consider: other sources first, minimum needed, repay quickly. Interest paid to self doesn\'t truly offset opportunity cost.'

      'C) Skipping RMDs',
      'D) Converting to Roth instead',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'RMD aggregation: calculate separately for each IRA, but can take total from any IRA(s). 403(b)s also aggregate. 401(k)s: must calculate AND withdraw from each separately. Strategy: take from least tax-efficient IRA, or one you\'re closing. Simplifies multiple IRAs. Inherited IRAs: separate from your own, each decedent\'s separate. Understanding enables tax-efficient withdrawal strategies.'

      'C) Early withdrawals only for emergencies',
      'D) Roth conversions'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'SEPP/72(t): avoid 10% penalty before 59½ by taking substantially equal payments. Methods: life expectancy, amortization, annuitization. Must continue: longer of 5 years or until 59½. Modification penalty if broken. Complex calculations—small errors costly. Last resort usually—locks in withdrawal pattern. Early retirees may find useful. Get professional help calculating.'

      'D) $10,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'QCD limits: $100,000 per individual (now indexed for inflation). Must be 70½ or older. Direct transfer to charity (not DAF). Counts toward RMD. Excludes from income (better than deduction for most). Each spouse can do up to limit from own IRA. One-time exception: up to $50,000 to split-interest entity (CRT, CGA).

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'WEP: reduces Social Security benefits for those with pensions from non-SS covered work (some state/local government jobs). Affects own benefit calculation.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Children\'s benefits: available when parent retires, disabled, or dies. Child must be: unmarried, under 18 (19 if full-time high school student), or disabled (if disability began before 22). Amount: up to 50% of parent\'s benefit (retirement/disability) or 75% (death). Family maximum applies. Older parents with young children: valuable benefit. Often overlooked in planning.'

      'C) Are never available',
      'B) Can be claimed for up to 6 months before application (but not before FRA), providing lump sum',
      'D) Require special application',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Retroactive benefits: can request up to 6 months of past benefits. But: can\'t go earlier than FRA, treated as earlier claiming date (permanently lower benefit). Trade-off: lump sum now vs. higher ongoing. Best for: those who delayed past FRA and need immediate funds. Don\'t accidentally elect retroactive if wanting highest ongoing benefit.'

      'C) Avoiding all stocks',
      'A) One investment account',
      'D) Annual rebalancing only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Bucket strategy: Bucket 1 (1-3 years): cash, short bonds—spend from here, peace of mind in downturns. Bucket 2 (4-10 years): bonds, balanced funds—refills Bucket 1. Bucket 3 (10+ years): stocks—growth, not touched in downturn. Psychological: easier to stay invested when near-term needs are secure. Mechanics: can be mental accounting or actual accounts.

      'D) Have high credit risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'TIPS: principal adjusts with CPI, interest paid on adjusted principal. Protects against inflation—real yield is guaranteed.

      'D) Reduced Social Security'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Part-time work benefits: income reduces portfolio draw (significant if early retirement), structure/purpose, social connections, may provide health insurance (critical pre-Medicare), enables Social Security delay. Considerations: earnings test if claiming early SS, continued saving possible, tax bracket impact. Many retirees prefer gradual transition. "Semi-retirement" increasingly common and beneficial.'

      'D) Requires hardship',

      'D) Ignores inflation adjustments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'AIME calculation: take each year\'s earnings (up to max taxable), adjust for wage inflation to current dollars, take highest 35 years, average, divide by 12 for monthly. Zeros count for years under 35! Implications: additional years of work can increase AIME (replace zeros or low years), high earnings late in career especially valuable if replacing zeros.

      'D) Avoiding all equities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Extending portfolio longevity: flexible withdrawals (guardrails—reduce in bad years), tax-efficient withdrawal ordering, minimize investment costs (compound benefit), delay Social Security (bridge with portfolio, then higher guaranteed), part-time income (reduce draws), downsize/reduce expenses. Every dollar not withdrawn continues compounding. Small adjustments have big long-term impact.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Mega backdoor Roth: some plans allow after-tax contributions (up to overall 415 limit ~$69K total), then in-service conversion to Roth (either in-plan Roth or Roth IRA). Result: additional Roth savings beyond normal limits. Requirements: plan must allow after-tax AND in-service conversion. Valuable for high earners maxing regular options.

    question: 'The decision to annuitize retirement assets should consider:',
    options: [
      'B) Unique mortality credits, loss of liquidity and legacy, existing guaranteed income, and personal health',
      'A) Only current interest rates',
      'C) Only tax benefits',
      'D) Market performance exclusively',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Annuity decision factors: Mortality credits (pooled risk—survivors benefit from those who die early). Loss: liquidity, legacy (unless features added), inflation protection (unless COLA). Consider: existing guaranteed income (SS, pension), health/life expectancy, desire for simplicity vs control, interest rate environment. Not all-or-nothing—partial annuitization common. Complex personal decision.'
