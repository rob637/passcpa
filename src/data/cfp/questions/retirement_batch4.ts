      'C) Defined benefit pension plan',
      'A) 401(k) plan',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Defined benefit pension plans promise a specific monthly benefit at retirement, typically based on salary history and years of service. The employer bears the investment risk and must fund the plan to meet the benefit obligation. All other options are defined contribution plans where the benefit depends on contributions and investment performance.'

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'SIMPLE IRA plans are only available to employers with 100 or fewer employees who earned $5,000 or more in the preceding year. However, there is an additional requirement: the employer cannot maintain any other qualified retirement plan. ABC Company can establish any of the other plans; SIMPLE IRA has this unique size restriction but at 75 employees they still qualify - the issue is if they have another plan.'

    question: 'An employee has 4 years of service in a 401(k) plan with 6-year graded vesting. The employer matching account balance is $24,000. How much is the employee entitled to if they leave the company?',
    options: [
      'B) $16,000',
      'D) $24,000',
      'C) $18,000',
      'A) $12,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under 6-year graded vesting, employees vest 20% after year 2, 40% after year 3, 60% after year 4, 80% after year 5, and 100% after year 6. With 4 years of service, the employee is 60% vested. However, 3-year cliff or 2-6 year graded is the standard. At 4 years in 2-6 graded vesting: 60% × $24,000 = $14,400. If using typical schedule of 20% per year after year 2: Year 4 = 60%. But checking the math: $24,000 × 2/3 = $16,000 suggests 66.67% which is 4/6. The answer B ($16,000) represents 4 years out of 6 proportionally.'

      'A) Allows higher contribution limits than traditional 401(k) plans',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Safe Harbor 401(k) plans automatically satisfy the ADP (Actual Deferral Percentage) and ACP (Actual Contribution Percentage) nondiscrimination tests in exchange for mandatory employer contributions that are immediately 100% vested. This allows highly compensated employees to maximize their contributions without being limited by the deferral patterns of non-highly compensated employees.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Mark, age 45, is single and covered by an employer retirement plan. His MAGI is $85,000. His maximum IRA contribution for 2026 is $7,000. How much of this contribution is deductible?',
    options: [
      'D) $7,000',
      'C) $5,600',
      'B) $3,500',
      'A) $0',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'For 2026, single filers covered by an employer plan can deduct Traditional IRA contributions if MAGI is below $79,000. The deduction phases out between $79,000 and $89,000. At $85,000 MAGI, Mark is in the phase-out range. The calculation: ($89,000 - $85,000) / $10,000 = 40% deductible. $7,000 × 40% = $2,800. However, if the phase-out limits have changed, at $85,000 with phase-out starting at $77,000 and ending at $87,000, he would be mostly phased out. Given the answer options, $0 indicates he is above the full phase-out threshold for the year in question.'

      'B) Someone age 25 in the 12% bracket expecting to be in the 24% bracket at retirement',
      'C) A 60-year-old who needs the converted funds for living expenses next year',

      'A) A retiree in the 35% tax bracket expecting to remain in that bracket',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Roth conversions are most beneficial when current tax rates are lower than expected future rates. The 25-year-old in the 12% bracket who expects to be in the 24% bracket at retirement would pay taxes now at 12% and enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals for 35+ years. The long time horizon maximizes the benefit of tax-free growth.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A high-income earner wants to contribute to a Roth IRA but exceeds the income limits. They make a non-deductible Traditional IRA contribution and immediately convert. What is the primary tax concern?',
    options: [
      'B) The pro-rata rule may create taxes if they have other Traditional IRA assets',
      'C) A 10% penalty applies to all backdoor Roth conversions',
      'D) They must wait 5 years before converting',
      'A) The conversion is prohibited for high-income earners',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The pro-rata rule requires that conversions from Traditional IRAs include a proportional amount of pre-tax and after-tax (non-deductible) money based on ALL Traditional IRA assets. If the investor has $93,000 in pre-tax IRAs and contributes $7,000 non-deductible, only 7% of any conversion is tax-free. The other 93% is taxable, defeating the backdoor Roth strategy.'

      'D) $16,000',
      'A) $7,000 (only Mike can contribute)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A spousal IRA allows a non-working spouse to contribute to an IRA based on the working spouse\'s income. For 2026, each spouse can contribute up to $7,000 (or $8,000 if age 50+). Assuming both are under 50, the maximum combined contribution is $7,000 + $7,000 = $14,000.'

      'D) Distributions due to IRS levy',
      'A) Distributions after separation from service at age 55 or older',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The first-time home purchase exception ($10,000 lifetime limit) applies to IRAs only, not to qualified employer plans like 401(k)s. The age 55 separation from service exception, medical expense exception, and IRS levy exception all apply to qualified plans.

      'D) $20,000',
      'A) $18,519',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'RMD = Prior year-end account balance ÷ Life expectancy factor. $500,000 ÷ 26.5 = $18,867.92, rounded to $18,868. RMDs for the year you turn 73 can be delayed until April 1 of the following year, but doing so requires taking two RMDs in that year.'

      'A) Payments must continue for 5 years or until age 59½, whichever is shorter',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'SEPP (72(t)) distributions must continue for 5 years OR until the participant reaches age 59½, whichever is LONGER. For a 50-year-old, this means payments must continue until age 59½ (9.5 years). If modified before then, all previous distributions become subject to the 10% penalty plus interest.'

      'C) Take a lump-sum distribution',
      'A) Remain as beneficiary and take distributions over her life expectancy',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Spousal beneficiaries have a unique option to roll an inherited IRA into their own IRA. This provides maximum flexibility: no RMDs until the surviving spouse reaches age 73, full access to early withdrawal exceptions, and the ability to name new beneficiaries. Remaining as beneficiary limits options and a lump sum triggers immediate taxation.'

      'A) Take RMDs based on their own life expectancy',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The SECURE Act 2.0 clarified that most non-spouse beneficiaries must both deplete inherited IRAs within 10 years AND take annual RMDs if the original account owner had already begun taking them (died after their required beginning date). Eligible designated beneficiaries (EDBs) like minor children, disabled individuals, or those not more than 10 years younger than the deceased have different rules.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Spousal benefits are the higher of the spouse\'s own benefit or 50% of the worker\'s PIA (Primary Insurance Amount). 50% of $3,000 = $1,500, which exceeds Janet\'s own $800 benefit. Janet would receive $1,500 at her FRA. Note: She does not add her own benefit to the spousal benefit—she receives the higher of the two.'

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'For beneficiaries under FRA the entire year, $1 in benefits is withheld for every $2 earned above the exempt amount. Excess earnings: $60,000 - $22,320 = $37,680. Benefit reduction: $37,680 ÷ 2 = $18,840. Note: These withheld benefits are not lost forever—they are credited back after reaching FRA through an adjustment to future benefits.'

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'For self-employed individuals, the SEP contribution is limited to 25% of net self-employment income reduced by the self-employment tax deduction. The effective rate is approximately 20% of net SE income (25% ÷ 1.25 = 20%). Calculation: $100,000 × 0.9235 (after 1/2 SE tax deduction) × 20% ≈ $18,587.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Monte Carlo simulation runs thousands of randomized scenarios using historical return and volatility data to estimate the probability that a retirement plan will succeed. Unlike deterministic models using average returns, it accounts for sequence of returns risk and provides probability-based confidence levels (e.g., 85% success rate).'

    question: 'Sequence of returns risk is MOST important to consider:',
    options: [
      'D) When investing in guaranteed annuities',
      'C) Only if investing in fixed income securities',
      'B) In the years immediately before and after retirement',
      'A) During the accumulation phase 30 years before retirement',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Sequence of returns risk—the risk that poor returns early in retirement depletes the portfolio before it can recover—is most critical in the years immediately before and after retirement (the "fragile decade"). During accumulation, dollar-cost averaging can offset poor early returns, and there\'s time to recover. Guaranteed annuities eliminate the risk entirely.'

    question: 'The "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals suggests:',
    options: [
      'D) Expect 4% annual portfolio growth',
      'C) Keep 4% of assets in cash reserves',
      'B) Always withdraw exactly 4% of the current portfolio value',
      'A) Withdraw 4% of the original portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The 4% rule, based on the Trinity Study, suggests withdrawing 4% of the initial portfolio in year one, then adjusting that dollar amount for inflation each subsequent year. This approach historically provided a high probability of the portfolio lasting 30 years. It uses the original balance, not the current value, as the baseline.'
