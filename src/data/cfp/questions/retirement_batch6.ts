    topic: 'Retirement Planning',
    subtopic: 'Sequence Risk',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Analysis',
    question: 'Sequence of returns risk is most problematic:',
    options: [
      'D) When using annuities exclusively',
      'B) During years immediately before and after retirement when the portfolio is largest',
      'A) During the early accumulation phase',
      'C) Only when investing in bonds',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Sequence risk matters most when withdrawals occur during market downturns, especially near retirement when the portfolio is largest. Poor returns early in retirement deplete assets faster, leaving less to benefit from later recovery. Mitigation strategies include bucket approaches, guardrails, and maintaining adequate cash reserves.'

    subtopic: 'Guardrails Strategy',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A "guardrails" withdrawal strategy:',
    options: [
      'B) Adjusts withdrawals based on portfolio performance to avoid depleting assets too quickly',
      'D) Only allows withdrawals from bonds',
      'A) Fixes the withdrawal amount regardless of portfolio performance',
      'C) Requires 100% stock allocation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Guardrails strategies (like Guyton-Klinger or dynamic spending rules) adjust withdrawals based on portfolio performance. If the portfolio drops significantly, spending decreases; if it grows substantially, spending may increase. This flexibility reduces sequence risk compared to fixed withdrawal approaches.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'An income floor strategy in retirement planning:',
    options: [
      'B) Creates guaranteed income from secure sources (Social Security, pensions, annuities) to cover essential expenses',
      'A) Maximizes investment risk for higher returns',
      'D) Relies solely on portfolio withdrawals',
      'C) Invests entirely in equities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Income floor strategies ensure essential expenses (housing, food, healthcare, insurance) are covered by guaranteed income sources. This provides psychological security and allows the remaining portfolio to be invested more aggressively for discretionary spending. Social Security, pensions, and SPIAs are common floor components.'

    question: 'Auto-escalation in 401(k) plans:',
    options: [
      'A) Automatically reduces contribution rates over time',
      'B) Automatically increases contribution rates annually until a target is reached',
      'D) Only applies to employer matching',
      'C) Requires employee action each year',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Auto-escalation automatically increases employee contribution rates annually (typically 1% per year) until reaching a target rate (often 10-15%). Combined with auto-enrollment, this addresses inertia and helps employees save adequately. Employees can opt out or change rates but many don\'t, benefiting from the defaults.'

    question: 'In-service distributions from 401(k) plans are typically available:',
    options: [
      'A) At any time for active employees',
      'B) After reaching age 59½ or meeting other plan-specific requirements',
      'D) Never for active employees',
      'C) Only for employer contributions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Most 401(k) plans allow in-service distributions after age 59½. Some plans permit earlier distributions under specific circumstances (hardship, disability, after-tax contributions). In-service distributions enable rollover to IRAs for more investment options or Roth conversions while still employed.'

      'B) Are unvested employer contributions that revert to the plan when employees leave before vesting',
      'C) Are always distributed equally to remaining participants',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Forfeitures occur when employees leave before fully vesting in employer contributions. These funds revert to the plan and can be used to reduce future employer contributions, pay plan expenses, or allocate to remaining participants. Forfeiture timing and use varies by plan document.'

      'B) Make only catch-up contributions',
      'C) Contribute unlimited amounts',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Spousal IRAs allow a non-working or low-earning spouse to contribute up to the annual limit ($7,000 for 2024, plus $1,000 catch-up if 50+) as long as the couple files jointly and the working spouse has sufficient earned income to cover both contributions.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'IRAs prohibit investments in life insurance (except some exceptions for qualified plans) and collectibles (art, antiques, gems, stamps, coins except certain U.S. coins, alcoholic beverages). Most other investments are permitted, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and real estate (though real estate requires a self-directed IRA).'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The Uniform Lifetime Table is used for RMD calculations when:',
    options: [

      'D) Only for inherited IRAs',
      'A) The beneficiary is more than 10 years younger than the owner',
      'C) The owner is under age 59½',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Most IRA owners use the Uniform Lifetime Table for RMD calculations. The Joint Life and Last Survivor Table is only used when the sole beneficiary is a spouse more than 10 years younger, resulting in smaller RMDs. The Single Life Expectancy Table is used for inherited IRAs.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',

    options: [
      'B) Delay of RMDs from current employer\'s plan (not IRAs) if still working and not a 5% owner',
      'D) Early distributions without penalty',
      'A) Delay of all IRA RMDs while employed',
      'C) Exemption from all RMDs permanently',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The still-working exception allows employees who are not 5% owners to delay RMDs from their current employer\'s retirement plan until they actually retire. It does NOT apply to IRAs or plans from prior employers. This allows continued tax-deferred growth while working past the RMD age.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The pro-rata rule for IRA distributions means:',
    options: [
      'D) Only the specific IRA distributed affects taxation',
      'B) Distributions from IRAs containing both pre-tax and after-tax amounts are taxed proportionally across all traditional IRAs',
      'A) All distributions are tax-free',
      'C) Roth conversions are always fully taxable',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The pro-rata rule aggregates all traditional, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs for determining the taxable portion of distributions. Even if withdrawing from an IRA with only after-tax contributions, the taxable portion is based on the ratio of after-tax to total IRA assets across all accounts. This affects backdoor Roth conversion planning.'

      'A) Anyone who is married',
      'B) Only those born before January 2, 1954 (grandfathered)',
      'D) Only widows and widowers',
      'C) Anyone who waits until FRA to claim',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 eliminated restricted applications for those born after January 1, 1954. Now, filing for any benefit automatically files for all eligible benefits. Those born before January 2, 1954 can still file a restricted application for spousal benefits at FRA while delaying their own benefit to earn delayed credits.'

      'A) 72',
      'D) FRA only',
      'C) 60 (or 50 if disabled)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Surviving spouses can claim reduced survivor benefits as early as age 60 (50 if disabled). Benefits increase up to survivor FRA. A widow(er) can strategically claim one benefit (own or survivor) early and switch to the larger benefit later. Remarriage before age 60 typically ends eligibility for deceased spouse\'s benefits.'

      'A) 100%',
      'B) 85%',
      'C) 50%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Up to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxable depending on "combined income" (AGI + nontaxable interest + 50% of SS benefits). Below $25K (single) or $32K (MFJ), benefits are tax-free. Between thresholds, up to 50% is taxable. Above $34K (single) or $44K (MFJ), up to 85% is taxable.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The income replacement ratio approach to retirement planning:',
    options: [
      'A) Assumes 100% of pre-retirement income is needed',
      'D) Is only used for early retirees',
      'B) Estimates retirement income needs as a percentage (typically 70-80%) of pre-retirement income',
      'C) Ignores Social Security in calculations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Replacement ratios estimate needed retirement income as a percentage of pre-retirement income, typically 70-80%. The reduction accounts for eliminated work expenses, taxes, and savings. The expense method is more precise but replacement ratios provide a useful quick estimate. Higher earners often need lower ratios.'

    options: [
      'A) Provides immediate income from purchase',
      'D) Is only available through employer plans',
      'B) Begins payments at a future age (often 80-85) to insure against outliving assets',
      'C) Has no role in retirement planning',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'DIAs (including QLACs in qualified accounts) provide payments starting at a future age, insuring against longevity risk. The delay allows for lower premiums or higher future payments. Knowing income is guaranteed from age 80-85+ allows more aggressive spending from other assets in earlier retirement years.'

      'A) Is a pure defined contribution plan',
      'C) Has no employer contribution',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Cash balance plans are defined benefit plans where participants have hypothetical account balances. Each year they receive pay credits (often percentage of salary) and interest credits. The employer bears investment risk. Benefits are typically portable as lump sums. Often paired with 401(k) for high-employer contribution strategies.'

    question: 'How does the universal availability requirement affect 403(b) plan administration differently than 401(k) plan eligibility rules?',
    options: [
      '403(b) plans can exclude employees based on job classification',
      '403(b) plans must generally offer participation to all employees, with limited exclusions, unlike 401(k) plans that can set age and service requirements more freely',
      '401(k) plans have stricter universal availability requirements than 403(b) plans',
      'Universal availability only applies to government 403(b) plans',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The universal availability requirement mandates that 403(b) plans must be offered to virtually all employees if offered to any, with limited exclusions (e.g., employees working fewer than 20 hours/week). This is more restrictive than 401(k) plans, which have more flexibility in setting eligibility criteria.',

      'B) Profit sharing contributions are discretionary while money purchase requires fixed annual contributions',
      'A) Only profit sharing allows Roth contributions',
      'C) Profit sharing has higher contribution limits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Profit sharing allows flexible employer contributions (0-25% of compensation annually based on profits and discretion). Money purchase pension plans require fixed annual contributions as a percentage of pay. Money purchase penalty for under-contribution makes them less flexible. Many employers prefer profit sharing for this flexibility.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'SEP contributions can be made up to the tax filing deadline including extensions. For self-employed individuals, this often means October 15 if extended.

      'D) Applies only when there are more than 5 beneficiaries',
      'C) Only applies to survivor benefits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The family maximum caps total benefits payable on one worker\'s record at 150-180% of the worker\'s PIA. When combined benefits exceed this, dependent and spousal benefits are proportionally reduced (the worker\'s benefit is not reduced). This affects families with multiple dependents claiming on one record.'
