    subtopic: 'Required Rate of Return',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'To calculate the required rate of return needed to meet retirement goals, a planner must consider:',
    options: [
      'C) Only inflation',
      'A) Only historical average returns',
      'D) Stock market predictions',
      'B) Current savings, future contributions, time horizon, and desired retirement income to solve for the rate needed',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The required rate is solved mathematically: given current savings, planned contributions, time to retirement, and needed retirement fund, what growth rate is needed? If the required rate exceeds reasonable expectations, adjustments are needed (save more, retire later, spend less). This reality check prevents unrealistic plans.'

      'D) Ignoring medical advances',
      'C) Only using average life expectancy',
      'A) Assuming life expectancy ends at 80',
      'B) Planning for the possibility of living significantly longer than average life expectancy, potentially to 90-95+',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Life expectancy is an average—half live longer. Planning to "average" risks running out of money. For a healthy 65-year-old couple, there\'s a 50% chance one survives to 92+. Plan for extended longevity (90-95) or use products like annuities to insure against outliving assets.'

      'B) TIPS, Social Security (inflation-adjusted), equities (historically outpace inflation), and inflation-adjusted annuities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Multiple sources provide inflation protection: Social Security has automatic COLAs, TIPS adjust with CPI, equities historically outpace inflation over time, and some annuities offer inflation riders. A diversified approach using multiple inflation-hedge sources is typically recommended.'

      'A) The employee bears investment risk',
      'B) The employer promises a specific benefit at retirement, typically based on salary and years of service',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'DB plans promise specific benefits (e.g., 2% × years × final average salary). The employer funds and invests to meet this obligation, bearing investment risk. Employees accrue benefits by formula. These plans are declining in private sector but common in government/union settings.'

      'C) Health savings account',
      'B) Defined benefit plan that expresses benefits as a hypothetical account balance with guaranteed interest credits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Cash balance plans are technically DB (employer-funded, promised benefit) but look like DC—each employee has a hypothetical account with annual pay credits (% of salary) and interest credits (guaranteed rate). Benefits are portable as lump sums. They favor younger employees relative to traditional DB.'

      'B) Insures defined benefit plans, paying benefits up to limits if plans terminate with insufficient assets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'PBGC is federal insurance for DB plans (funded by employer premiums). If a DB plan terminates underfunded, PBGC pays benefits up to annual limits (around $70K at 65 in 2026). It doesn\'t cover DC plans, government plans, or church plans. Single-employer and multiemployer programs have different rules.'

    options: [
      'A) Must take RMDs based on their life expectancy',
      'C) Cannot access the funds',
      'D) Must take everything immediately',
      'B) Under SECURE Act, must generally empty the account within 10 years, but withdrawals are tax-free',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'SECURE Act\'s 10-year rule applies to Roth IRAs for most non-spouse beneficiaries. The 10-year rule is the same, but Roth distributions are tax-free (if 5-year holding was met). This allows strategic timing within the 10 years—there are no annual RMDs, so all can be taken at once or spread.'

      'B) Self-dealing transactions like borrowing from the IRA, selling property to it, or using IRA assets for personal benefit',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Prohibited transactions (IRC 4975) include: borrowing from IRA, selling property to it, using IRA assets as loan security, or receiving compensation from IRA investments. Disqualified persons (owner, family, fiduciaries) cannot engage in these. Penalty is severe: entire IRA becomes taxable.'

      'B) Are subject to a 6% excise tax each year until corrected',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Excess contributions incur 6% penalty annually until corrected. Can be corrected by: withdrawing excess plus earnings by tax deadline (including extensions), applying excess to following year (if under limit), or withdrawing in subsequent years when contributions are below limit.'

      'C) Cannot exceed $50,000',
      'A) Must begin payments immediately',
      'D) Is available only in Roth accounts',
      'B) Defers income to as late as age 85, providing longevity insurance while being excluded from RMD calculations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'QLACs allow up to $200,000 (SECURE 2.0 increased limit) to be used for deferred annuities starting by age 85. The QLAC amount is excluded from RMD calculations, reducing required distributions. This provides pure longevity insurance—if you die before payments start, benefits are limited (often to spouse or return of premium).'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA) strategy for employer stock in a 401(k):',
    options: [
      'A) Applies to all investments',
      'C) Is only beneficial for small amounts',
      'D) Requires Roth conversion',
      'B) Allows distributing employer stock in-kind, paying ordinary tax on cost basis only, with NUA taxed at capital gains rates when sold',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'NUA strategy: instead of rolling employer stock to IRA, distribute in-kind to taxable account. Ordinary income tax applies only to cost basis; the appreciation (NUA) is taxed at long-term capital gains rates when sold. This works best with large NUA (low basis, high current value) and lower capital gains rates.'

      'C) Immediate lump sum is required',
      'D) Five-year rule always applies',
      'A) Stretch distributions continue based on life expectancy',
      'B) The account must be fully distributed within 10 years of the owner\'s death',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'SECURE Act (2019) eliminated life-expectancy stretch for most non-spouse beneficiaries—10-year rule applies. Exceptions (eligible designated beneficiaries): surviving spouses, minor children (until majority), disabled/chronically ill individuals, and beneficiaries not more than 10 years younger than the deceased.'

      'D) Needs-based benefits only',
      'C) Short-term disability coverage',
      'A) The same benefits regardless of work history',
      'B) Benefits to disabled workers who have sufficient work credits, based on their earnings record',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'SSDI is social insurance (not need-based) for workers with enough credits who become disabled. Disability definition is strict: unable to perform substantial gainful activity for 12+ months or terminal. Benefits based on earnings record (like retirement). After 24 months of SSDI, Medicare eligibility begins.'

    question: 'If claiming Social Security before Full Retirement Age while still working:',
    options: [
      'D) Working is prohibited',
      'A) All earnings are exempt',
      'C) Benefits are permanently reduced',
      'B) Benefits may be reduced if earnings exceed annual limits, but those reductions are restored later',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The retirement earnings test (before FRA) reduces benefits—$1 per $2 over limit (around $22K). In FRA year, reduction is $1 per $3 over higher limit. At FRA, no reduction. Importantly, reduced benefits aren\'t lost—they\'re restored through higher benefits after FRA. After FRA, earnings don\'t affect benefits.'

      'A) All Social Security recipients',
      'D) Medicare benefits',
      'C) Only high earners',
      'B) Workers with pensions from non-covered employment (like some government jobs), reducing their Social Security benefits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'WEP reduces Social Security for those with pensions from work not covered by Social Security (federal pre-1984, some state/local, foreign employers). The benefit formula\'s first tier is reduced—sometimes substantially. "Substantial coverage" (30+ years of covered work) phases out WEP.'

    question: 'Retirement spending research suggests:',
    options: [
      'A) Spending remains constant throughout retirement',
      'D) Spending always increases with inflation',
      'C) Only essential expenses matter',
      'B) Spending often follows phases: active early retirement, slower middle years, and potentially higher healthcare costs late',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The "retirement spending smile" shows: higher discretionary spending in early "go-go" years (travel, activities), reduced spending in "slow-go" years (less activity), and potential increase in "no-go" years (healthcare/long-term care). This non-linear pattern affects planning assumptions.'

      'D) Is the same as an ESOP',
      'B) Is similar to a profit-sharing plan but must distribute benefits in employer stock (though cash payments for fractional shares allowed)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Stock bonus plans are DC plans distributing employer stock. They\'re related to ESOPs but without all ESOP rules (like put option, diversification). Benefits vary with employer contribution and stock performance. They align employee and employer interests but concentrate risk. Diversification is important after receiving distributions.'

      'D) Only affects RMDs',
      'B) For tax purposes, all traditional IRAs are treated as one, affecting Roth conversion taxation based on total pre-tax IRA balances',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'All traditional IRAs (including SEP and SIMPLE) are treated as one for determining the pro-rata tax on conversions or non-deductible withdrawals. If you have any pre-tax IRA money, you can\'t convert just after-tax portions tax-free—the pro-rata rule applies. Strategies include rolling pre-tax amounts to 401(k).'

      'B) To transfer up to $108,000 annually directly to charity, satisfying RMDs without inclusion in taxable income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'QCDs transfer IRA funds directly to charity (not donor-advised funds or private foundations). They satisfy RMDs without increasing AGI—beneficial for those not itemizing or subject to phase-outs. 2026 limit is $108,000 (indexed). SECURE 2.0 added one-time $54,000 gift to charitable trusts/annuities.'

      'B) Total benefits payable on one worker\'s record when multiple beneficiaries (spouse, children) are entitled',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'When multiple people receive benefits on one worker\'s record (spouse, children, ex-spouse doesn\'t reduce), the family maximum applies—typically 150-180% of PIA for retirement, 85-150% for disability. Benefits are proportionally reduced to stay within limits. The ex-spouse\'s benefit doesn\'t count toward family maximum.'

      'B) Taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred, then Roth—though flexibility is needed based on brackets and circumstances',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The "traditional" order: taxable (often lowest tax cost, preserves tax-deferred growth), then tax-deferred (ordinary income), then Roth (tax-free). But sophisticated strategies consider filling lower tax brackets, Roth conversion opportunities, and ACA subsidies. There\'s no one-size-fits-all sequence.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Age-50+ can contribute extra: $7,500 for 401(k)/403(b) in 2026. SECURE 2.0 adds higher catch-up for ages 60-63 starting 2025. IRA catch-up is $1,000.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'SIMPLE IRAs have lower limits than 401(k)s: $17,000 employee deferral in 2026 (vs $23,500 for 401(k)), $3,500 catch-up (vs $7,500). Employer must match 1-3% or provide 2% non-elective. They\'re simpler to administer but have lower contribution potential for higher earners.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Calculate RMD for each IRA separately, but the total can be withdrawn from any one or combination. This allows keeping accounts with better investments/terms while satisfying RMDs from others. 401(k)s differ: each 401(k) must satisfy its own RMD (no aggregation across employer plans).'

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'If you file after FRA, you can receive up to 6 months of retroactive benefits—but doing so permanently reduces your benefit (as if you claimed earlier). You can\'t get retroactive benefits for months before FRA. Consider carefully: lump sum now versus higher lifetime benefit.'
