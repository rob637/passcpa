    topic: 'Life Insurance',
    subtopic: 'Needs Analysis',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The human life value approach to determining life insurance needs considers:',
    options: [
      'B) The present value of the insured\'s future earnings',
      'D) Only the mortgage balance',
      'A) Only current debts and funeral expenses',
      'C) The face value of existing policies',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The human life value approach calculates the present value of the insured\'s future income stream that would be lost upon death. It considers factors like current income, expected raises, years until retirement, and an appropriate discount rate. This approach often results in higher insurance needs than the needs analysis approach.'

    difficulty: 'easy',

    question: 'Term life insurance differs from permanent life insurance primarily because term:',
    options: [
      'B) Provides coverage for a specified period only',
      'A) Accumulates cash value',
      'D) Guarantees coverage for life',
      'C) Has higher initial premiums',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Term insurance provides death benefit protection for a specified period (term) without cash value accumulation. It has lower initial premiums but no coverage beyond the term. Permanent insurance (whole life, universal life) provides lifetime coverage with cash value accumulation at higher initial premiums.'

      'D) Decreasing death benefit',
      'C) Investment in separate accounts',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Traditional whole life insurance features fixed premiums, guaranteed death benefits, and guaranteed cash value accumulation. The insurer invests in its general account and bears the investment risk. This differs from universal life (flexible premiums) and variable life (separate accounts with investment risk on the owner).'

      'C) Universal life',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Universal life offers premium flexibility (within limits), adjustable death benefits, and transparent cost structure showing mortality charges, expense charges, and interest credits. The policyholder can increase or decrease premiums and coverage as needs change, within policy guidelines.'

    question: 'If a policyholder with $100,000 cash value borrows $40,000 and dies with the loan outstanding, the beneficiary receives:',

      'B) The death benefit minus $40,000 plus any accrued interest',
      'C) Nothing, as the loan voids the policy',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Outstanding policy loans and accrued interest are deducted from the death benefit. If the face amount is $500,000 and the outstanding loan with interest is $42,000, the beneficiary receives $458,000. Policy loans are not "free money"—they reduce the death benefit if not repaid.'

      'C) Inability to work at least 20 hours per week',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Own-occupation is the most liberal definition—you are disabled if you cannot perform the duties of your specific occupation, even if you could work in another field. "Any-occupation" policies (less favorable) require inability to work in any job for which you are reasonably suited by education and experience.'

      'A) The maximum duration benefits will be paid',
      'B) The waiting period before benefits begin',
      'D) The period during which premiums are waived',
      'C) The time before pre-existing conditions are covered',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The elimination period (waiting period) is the time after disability begins before benefits are payable—similar to a deductible, but measured in time rather than dollars. Longer elimination periods (90 days vs. 30 days) result in lower premiums. Emergency funds should cover this waiting period.'

    question: 'Disability benefits from a personally-owned policy with premiums paid with after-tax dollars are:',
    options: [
      'A) Fully taxable as ordinary income',
      'B) Tax-free to the recipient',
      'D) Subject to 10% penalty tax',
      'C) Taxable at capital gains rates',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'If premiums are paid with after-tax personal dollars, benefits are tax-free. If premiums are paid by the employer (or pre-tax through a cafeteria plan), benefits are taxable. This is why personally-owned policies with after-tax premiums can replace a higher percentage of income effectively—benefits are not reduced by taxes.'

      'A) The original purchase price of the item',
      'D) A fixed cash amount regardless of loss',
      'C) The current market value minus depreciation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Replacement cost coverage pays to replace damaged property with similar new property without deducting depreciation. Actual Cash Value (ACV) = Replacement cost minus depreciation. Replacement cost coverage provides better protection but has higher premiums.'

      'A) $100,000',
      'B) $87,500',
      'C) $80,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Coinsurance formula: (Insurance carried ÷ Insurance required) × Loss = Payment. Required: $400,000 × 80% = $320,000. Carried: $280,000. Payment: ($280,000 ÷ $320,000) × $100,000 = 87.5% × $100,000 = $87,500. Underinsurance results in the policyholder sharing the loss.'

      'D) Is required by most mortgage lenders',
      'B) Provides excess liability coverage above underlying policies',
      'C) Covers only weather-related damage',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Umbrella policies provide excess liability coverage (typically $1-5 million or more) above auto, homeowners, and other primary policies. They also provide broader coverage for some claims not covered by underlying policies. Underlying policies with minimum limits are usually required.'

      'A) $100 deductible, $300 liability, $50 medical',
      'C) $100K collision, $300K comprehensive, $50K uninsured motorist',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The split limits (100/300/50) represent: $100,000 maximum bodily injury per person, $300,000 maximum bodily injury per accident, and $50,000 property damage liability. Higher limits are generally recommended, and many advisors suggest combined single limit policies.'

      'A) Reaches age 65',
      'C) Is hospitalized for more than 30 days',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Tax-qualified LTC policies require inability to perform at least 2 of 6 ADLs (bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring, continence) for 90+ days, or cognitive impairment requiring substantial supervision. This is the benefit trigger that starts policy payments.'

      'A) No inflation protection (lower premium)',
      'C) Simple 3% inflation protection',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'For younger purchasers with decades before likely claim, compound inflation protection provides the best long-term value despite higher initial premiums. Over 20-30 years, compound growth significantly outpaces simple inflation adjustments. Future purchase options require evidence of insurability and may be declined.'

      'C) Subject to capital gains tax',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Life insurance death benefits are generally income tax-free to beneficiaries under IRC Section 101. However, proceeds may be included in the insured\'s taxable estate if the insured owned the policy or had "incidents of ownership." Interest earned on proceeds held by the insurer is taxable.'

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Life income settlement converts the death benefit into an annuity paying for the beneficiary\'s lifetime.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Medigap policies fill the "gaps" in Original Medicare, covering costs like Part A and B deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. Standardized plans (A through N) have defined benefits. Medigap cannot be used with Medicare Advantage plans and does not cover Part D (prescriptions).'
