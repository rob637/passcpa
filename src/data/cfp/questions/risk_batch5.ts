    subtopic: 'Risk Tolerance vs Capacity',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Analysis',
    question: 'Risk tolerance and risk capacity differ in that:',
    options: [
      'B) Risk tolerance is emotional/psychological willingness to accept risk, while risk capacity is financial ability to absorb losses',
      'C) Risk capacity is more important than risk tolerance',
      'D) Neither affects insurance decisions',
      'A) They are the same concept',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Risk tolerance is subjective—how comfortable someone feels with uncertainty. Risk capacity is objective—the financial ability to survive losses without jeopardizing goals. Insurance plans should address gaps between the two, transferring risks the client can\'t afford regardless of comfort level.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Self-insurance is most appropriate for losses that are:',
    options: [
      'C) Unpredictable',
      'B) Low frequency and low severity, or where insurance costs exceed expected losses',
      'D) Covered by employers',
      'A) High frequency and high severity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Self-insurance (retention) makes sense for small, manageable losses where insurance administrative costs exceed expected claims. High deductibles accomplish partial self-insurance. It\'s inappropriate for catastrophic risks where a single loss could cause financial ruin.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Adverse selection in insurance markets occurs when:',
    options: [
      'D) Claims are denied unfairly',
      'B) Those with higher risks are more likely to purchase insurance, creating an imbalanced risk pool',
      'C) Premiums decrease over time',
      'A) Insurers select profitable customers',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Adverse selection means high-risk individuals disproportionately buy insurance while low-risk individuals opt out, making the risk pool more expensive. Insurers counter with underwriting, waiting periods, and pre-existing condition exclusions. The ACA addressed this in health insurance with guaranteed issue and mandates.'

    question: 'Policy loans from permanent life insurance:',
    options: [
      'B) Allow tax-free access to cash value, with unpaid loans reducing death benefits',
      'D) Cannot be taken before age 59½',
      'C) Are taxable as ordinary income',
      'A) Reduce the death benefit dollar-for-dollar',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Policy loans access cash value without immediate tax (they\'re loans, not distributions). Interest accrues on loans. Outstanding loans reduce the death benefit paid to beneficiaries. If the policy lapses with loans exceeding basis, taxes and potentially surrender charges apply.'

    subtopic: 'Waiver of Premium',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Under what circumstances does a waiver of premium rider typically become effective on a life insurance policy?',
    options: [
      'When the insured reaches age 65 and retires',
      'When the insured becomes totally disabled as defined by the policy, typically after a waiting period of 6 months',
      'When the policyholder requests a premium reduction for any reason',
      'When the policy\'s cash value exceeds the annual premium amount',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A waiver of premium rider waives future premium payments when the insured becomes totally disabled as defined in the policy, typically after a 6-month elimination (waiting) period. The policy remains in force with all benefits intact while premiums are waived during the disability.',

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'The incontestability clause in life insurance:',
    options: [
      'D) Begins at death',
      'C) Only applies if premiums are paid in full',
      'B) Prevents insurers from denying claims after the policy has been in force (typically 2 years), except for fraud',
      'A) Allows claims to be denied any time for misrepresentation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'After the contestability period (usually 2 years), insurers generally cannot deny claims based on application misstatements. Exceptions include fraud (though some states bar even fraud defenses after the period). This protects beneficiaries from ancient misrepresentations affecting death claims.'

    options: [
      'D) The same amount for everyone',
      'C) Only available to the unemployed',
      'B) Based on income and the cost of benchmark plans, reducing premiums for those between 100-400% of poverty level',
      'A) Available regardless of income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Premium subsidies limit marketplace plan costs to a percentage of income (sliding scale based on Federal Poverty Level). Subsidies equal the difference between the benchmark Silver plan cost and the expected contribution. Enhanced subsidies through 2025 expanded eligibility and lowered contribution percentages.'

    question: 'Short-term health insurance plans:',
    options: [
      'B) Provide temporary coverage with limited benefits and may exclude pre-existing conditions',
      'C) Are ACA-compliant plans',
      'D) Have guaranteed renewal',
      'A) Must cover pre-existing conditions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Short-term plans fill gaps between coverage but aren\'t ACA-compliant. They can exclude pre-existing conditions, have lifetime/annual limits, and limited benefits. Duration varies by state (up to 3 years). They\'re cheaper but provide less comprehensive protection; appropriate for healthy individuals needing temporary coverage.'

    question: 'Health care sharing ministries:',
    options: [
      'B) Are religious organizations that share medical costs among members but are not insurance and don\'t guarantee payment',
      'C) Must cover all conditions',
      'D) Provide the same protections as ACA plans',
      'A) Are regulated like insurance companies',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'HCSMs allow members (sharing religious beliefs) to help pay each other\'s medical bills. They\'re not insurance—there\'s no guarantee of payment, pre-existing conditions may be excluded, and they\'re exempt from ACA requirements. Lower cost but higher risk; monthly "shares" aren\'t legally premiums.'

    id: 'cfp-ris-b5-010',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-RISK',
    blueprintArea: 'RISK-4',
    topic: 'Disability Insurance',
    subtopic: 'Cost of Living',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) rider on disability insurance:',
    options: [
      'C) Adjusts benefits for location',
      'B) Increases benefits during a claim to keep pace with inflation',
      'D) Only applies the first year',
      'A) Increases premiums each year',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'COLA riders increase disability benefits annually (typically tied to CPI or a fixed percentage) during a continuing claim. For long-term disabilities, this is crucial—a 20-year claim without COLA would see purchasing power erode significantly. The rider adds cost but provides inflation protection.'

    subtopic: 'Integration',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Disability policy integration means:',
    options: [
      'C) Only one policy can be owned',
      'B) Benefits may be reduced by amounts received from other sources like Social Security or workers\' compensation',
      'D) Benefits are paid before other sources',
      'A) Multiple policies pay full benefits simultaneously',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Integration provisions reduce policy benefits by amounts from other disability sources to prevent "profiting" from disability. Group LTD policies often integrate with Social Security. "Non-integrated" or "pure" policies pay regardless of other benefits—they cost more but provide predictable coverage.'
  },
  {
    id: 'cfp-ris-b5-012',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-RISK',

    subtopic: 'Business Overhead',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Business overhead expense (BOE) insurance:',
    options: [
      'B) Pays for business operating expenses if the owner becomes disabled, helping keep the business running',
      'D) Only covers employee salaries',
      'C) Is the same as business interruption insurance',
      'A) Replaces the owner\'s income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'BOE covers fixed business expenses (rent, utilities, employee salaries, equipment leases) when the owner is disabled. It\'s separate from personal disability insurance. Benefits are typically tax-deductible as business expenses but the premiums are not. Usually has shorter benefit periods (1-2 years).'

    topic: 'Long-Term Care',
    subtopic: 'ADLs and Cognitive Impairment',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Most LTC policies require the insured to need help with a certain number of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) or have cognitive impairment. ADLs include:',
    options: [
      'B) Bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring, and continence',
      'D) Working and exercising',
      'C) Shopping, cooking, and driving',
      'A) Walking, running, and swimming',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The standard 6 ADLs are bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, transferring (moving between bed/chair), and continence. Most policies require inability to perform 2+ ADLs or cognitive impairment (like Alzheimer\'s) to trigger benefits. Tax-qualified plans must meet these criteria.'

    topic: 'Long-Term Care',
    subtopic: 'Shared Care',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A shared care rider on LTC insurance allows:',
    options: [
      'D) Benefits to be paid to family members',
      'B) Spouses to access each other\'s benefits if one exhausts their own, extending potential coverage',
      'C) Sharing costs with Medicaid',
      'A) Multiple insureds to share one policy',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Shared care lets couples pool benefits—if one spouse exhausts their benefit pool, they can draw from the other\'s. This provides flexibility for couples where one may need more care. Some versions add a shared pool beyond individual benefits. It costs more but provides valuable protection.'

    topic: 'Long-Term Care',
    subtopic: 'Rate Increases',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Analysis',
    question: 'Traditional LTC insurance premiums:',
    options: [
      'D) Are always higher than hybrid products',
      'C) Decrease as the insured ages',
      'B) Can increase for entire rate classes if approved by regulators, though individual experience doesn\'t trigger increases',
      'A) Are guaranteed never to increase',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Traditional LTC is not "guaranteed level"—premiums can increase for entire rate classes (though not based on individual claims). Many legacy policies had significant increases due to underpricing. Hybrid products often have guaranteed premiums but less LTC leverage. Rate stability is a major LTC planning concern.'

      'D) Discrimination in underwriting',
      'B) The tendency to take more risks or be less careful when protected by insurance',
      'A) Insurance fraud',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Moral hazard is increased risk-taking because someone else bears the cost. With auto insurance, people may drive less carefully; with health insurance, they may overuse services. Insurers counter with deductibles, copays, and coinsurance to maintain "skin in the game."'

      'C) Required by law for all businesses',
      'D) Only for publicly traded companies',
      'A) Personal life insurance for executives',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Key person insurance compensates businesses for economic loss when essential employees die. The business owns the policy, pays premiums (non-deductible), and receives tax-free proceeds. It helps cover replacement costs, lost revenue, and business stabilization. Common for founders, sales leads, and specialized talent.'

      'D) Are available only to low-income beneficiaries',
      'A) Only cover hospital stays',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Medicare Advantage replaces Original Medicare with private plans that must cover Part A and B benefits. Many include Part D, plus extras like dental, vision, hearing, and fitness. Trade-offs include network restrictions and prior authorization requirements. They can\'t be combined with Medigap.'

    question: 'A presumptive disability provision:',
    options: [
      'C) Applies only to occupational injuries',
      'B) Automatically considers certain losses (sight, hearing, limbs) as total disability regardless of ability to work',
      'D) Extends the elimination period',
      'A) Requires proof of occupational disability',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Presumptive disability automatically qualifies claims for total disability upon specific losses (e.g., loss of sight in both eyes, use of both hands/feet, speech, hearing) without requiring proof of occupational disability. Benefits may begin immediately, waiving the elimination period.'

      'D) Have lower benefits than non-qualified',
      'A) Have looser benefit triggers than non-qualified policies',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Tax-qualified LTC policies meet HIPAA standards. Premiums are deductible as medical expenses (with age-based limits, subject to 7.5% AGI floor). Benefits are tax-free when triggered by ADL/cognitive criteria. Non-TQ policies may have easier triggers but uncertain tax treatment.'

    question: 'In health insurance, coinsurance of 80/20 means:',
    options: [
      'C) 80% of claims are covered',
      'B) After the deductible, the insurer pays 80% and the insured pays 20% until the out-of-pocket maximum',
      'D) The premium is split 80/20',
      'A) The insured pays 80% of costs',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: '80/20 coinsurance means the insurer pays 80% of covered costs and the insured pays 20%, applied after the deductible. Cost-sharing continues until the annual out-of-pocket maximum is reached, after which the insurer pays 100%. It creates incentives to be cost-conscious about care.'

      'C) Only new policies',
      'A) Only naming charities as beneficiaries',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Charitable life insurance strategies include: (1) naming charity as beneficiary (no current deduction, but estate deduction), (2) gifting existing policy to charity (deduct interpolated terminal reserve), (3) charity owns and is beneficiary (deduct premiums as gifts). Charity gets larger gift than direct cash donation of same amount.'

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'HSAs are owned by individuals, roll over indefinitely (no use-it-or-lose-it), have higher limits ($4,450/$8,900 in 2026), and offer triple tax benefits (deductible, grow tax-free, tax-free withdrawals for medical).

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Care coordinators (typically nurses or social workers) assess needs, develop care plans, identify local resources, and help navigate the LTC system. This adds value beyond just payment—families often need guidance on care options. Some policies include it; others charge separately.'
