    topic: 'Risk Analysis',
    subtopic: 'Risk Mapping',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Risk mapping in personal financial planning involves:',
    options: [
      'B) Identifying and assessing all significant risks by probability and potential impact, then determining appropriate mitigation strategies',
      'C) Avoiding all risks',
      'A) Only looking at insurance policies',
      'D) Purchasing maximum insurance',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Risk mapping uses a matrix: probability of occurrence vs. severity of impact. High probability/high impact risks demand immediate attention (transfer or reduce). Low probability/low impact may be retained. This systematic approach ensures resources focus on the most significant risks first.'

    subtopic: 'Pure vs Speculative Risk',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Pure risk differs from speculative risk in that pure risk:',
    options: [
      'B) Involves only the possibility of loss or no loss, with no chance of gain',
      'C) Cannot be insured',
      'A) Offers potential for gain',
      'D) Only affects businesses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Pure risk: only loss or no loss possible (fire, death, liability). Speculative risk: potential for gain, loss, or no change (investments, gambling, business ventures). Insurance typically covers pure risks—insurers can price based on loss probability without considering gain.'

    subtopic: 'Maximum Probable Loss',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Maximum probable loss (MPL) refers to:',
    options: [
      'B) The most likely loss amount in a worst-case scenario that could realistically occur, used to determine appropriate coverage levels',
      'C) Average claim experience',
      'A) Total value of all assets',
      'D) Deductible amounts',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'MPL is the largest loss that would probably result from a single event—not the absolute maximum (which might be astronomical) but a realistic worst-case. It helps size insurance limits appropriately. For example, MPL for a home might be replacement cost less salvage value, not including the land.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Survivorship (second-to-die) life insurance:',
    options: [
      'A) Pays when the first insured dies',
      'B) Pays only after both insureds die, typically used for estate liquidity since estate tax is deferred until the second spouse\'s death',
      'C) Is term insurance only',
      'D) Insures children'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Second-to-die pays at the survivor\'s death—when estate taxes (with marital deduction) are due. Premiums are lower than individual policies because two lives are covered. Often used in ILITs for estate liquidity. Also useful when one spouse is uninsurable—joint coverage may be obtainable.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A life settlement differs from a viatical settlement in that:',
    options: [
      'A) They are identical',
      'B) Life settlements are for insureds typically over 65 who are not terminally ill; viaticals are for terminally or chronically ill insureds',
      'C) Life settlements have no tax implications',
      'D) Viaticals pay more'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Viatical settlements: terminally/chronically ill sell policies, often tax-free under IRC 101(g). Life settlements: seniors (typically 65+) sell unwanted policies for more than cash value but less than death benefit. Life settlement proceeds are taxable—ordinary income to extent of premium recovered, then capital gains.'

    subtopic: 'Corridor/Guideline Requirements',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'The corridor or guideline premium tests for life insurance exist to:',
    options: [
      'C) Limit premiums',
      'A) Maximize investment returns',
      'B) Ensure policies maintain sufficient death benefit relative to cash value to qualify as life insurance rather than an investment',
      'D) Avoid all taxation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'IRC 7702 defines life insurance through cash value accumulation test (CVAT) or guideline premium/corridor test (GPT). Both ensure death benefit remains meaningfully greater than cash value. Without these limits, policies become investment vehicles without insurance taxation benefits. The corridor requires minimum death benefit relative to cash value.'

    topic: 'Disability Insurance',
    subtopic: 'Residual Disability',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'A physician with a disability insurance policy containing a residual disability rider returns to work part-time earning 60% of their pre-disability income. How is the residual benefit typically calculated?',
    options: [
      'The full monthly benefit is paid regardless of current earnings',
      'The benefit is proportional to the income loss — approximately 40% of the full monthly benefit reflecting the 40% earnings reduction',
      'The benefit equals the difference between pre-disability income and SSDI benefits',
      'No benefit is paid because the insured has returned to work',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Residual disability benefits are typically proportional to the income loss. If the insured earns 60% of pre-disability income (40% loss), the benefit equals approximately 40% of the full monthly benefit. This encourages rehabilitation and return-to-work while providing income support during the transition.',

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A Social Insurance Supplement/Offset rider on disability insurance:',
    options: [
      'A) Eliminates Social Security',
      'C) Is mandatory',
      'B) Reduces policy benefits by Social Security disability received, or provides additional benefit if SSDI is denied',
      'D) Only applies to group plans',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Social Insurance Supplement (SIS) provides extra benefit if SSDI is denied or delayed. Social Insurance Offset reduces the base benefit by SSDI received. The combination ensures adequate coverage while avoiding over-insurance. SSDI is difficult to obtain (strict definition), so SIS provides needed interim/permanent protection.'

    question: 'Business overhead expense (BOE) disability insurance covers:',
    options: [
      'C) Business start-up costs',
      'B) Business operating expenses (rent, utilities, employee salaries, loan payments) while the owner is disabled',
      'A) The owner\'s salary',
      'D) Only equipment purchases',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'BOE policies reimburse normal operating expenses when a business owner is disabled, keeping the business viable during recovery. They don\'t cover the owner\'s income (that\'s individual disability). Benefits typically last 12-24 months. Premiums are tax-deductible as business expense; benefits are taxable.'

  // RIS-4: Property Insurance
  {
    id: 'cfp-ris-b6-010',
    courseId: 'cfp',
    section: 'CFP-RISK',
    blueprintArea: 'RISK-4',
    topic: 'Property Insurance',
    subtopic: 'Actual Cash Value vs Replacement Cost',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Actual cash value (ACV) coverage differs from replacement cost in that ACV:',
    options: [
      'C) Only applies to vehicles',
      'A) Pays more',
      'B) Deducts depreciation from replacement cost, resulting in lower claim payments for older items',
      'D) Is not available in homeowners policies',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'ACV = Replacement Cost - Depreciation. A 10-year-old roof destroyed might only receive 30-40% of replacement cost under ACV. Replacement cost coverage pays to replace/repair with new materials. The premium difference is usually worth it for significant protection against depreciation.'

    subtopic: 'Inflation Guard',
    difficulty: 'easy',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'An inflation guard endorsement on homeowners insurance:',
    options: [
      'C) Reduces premiums',
      'B) Automatically increases coverage limits periodically to keep pace with construction cost increases',
      'A) Freezes coverage amounts',
      'D) Is included in all policies',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Inflation guard automatically increases dwelling coverage (typically quarterly) to match rising construction costs. Without it, a home insured at $300K five years ago might be underinsured as replacement costs rose. The premium increases proportionally. Most advisers recommend this endorsement.'

    topic: 'Property Insurance',
    subtopic: 'Ordinance or Law Coverage',
    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Ordinance or law coverage in homeowners insurance pays for:',
    options: [
      'C) Property taxes',
      'B) Increased costs to rebuild to current building codes when they exceed original construction standards',
      'A) Legal fees only',
      'D) Zoning variances',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'After a loss, rebuilding must meet current codes, which may exceed original construction. Standard policies may not cover this gap. Ordinance coverage pays: 1) demolition of undamaged portions if required, 2) increased building costs for code compliance, and 3) loss of undamaged portions that must be demolished.'

  // RIS-5: Liability Insurance
  {
    id: 'cfp-ris-b6-013',

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A personal umbrella liability policy provides:',
    options: [
      'B) Excess liability protection above home and auto limits, plus broader coverage for some claims not covered by underlying policies',
      'A) Coverage for business activities',
      'C) Only auto liability',
      'D) Property coverage',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Umbrellas provide: 1) excess liability above auto/homeowners limits (e.g., $1M-$10M), 2) broader coverage (some personal injury claims, liability abroad), 3) relatively inexpensive protection for catastrophic claims. They require maintaining specified underlying auto/home limits and typically exclude business/professional liability.'

    options: [
      'B) Claims arising from professional negligence, errors, or omissions in providing professional services',
      'A) Only bodily injury',
      'C) General business liability',
      'D) Product defects',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Professional liability (errors & omissions) covers claims from professional service failures—negligent advice, missed deadlines, errors in work product. It\'s essential for CFP® professionals. Policies are claims-made (covering claims made during policy period regardless of when error occurred), unlike occurrence-based general liability.'

      'B) Coverage for employee injuries regardless of fault, including medical expenses and wage replacement',
      'C) Retirement benefits',
      'D) Unemployment compensation'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Workers comp is no-fault coverage for work-related injuries/illnesses: medical care, wage replacement (typically 2/3 of wages), rehabilitation, and death benefits. Employees generally cannot sue employers for covered injuries. Required in most states for most employers. Rates vary by job classification risk.'

      'C) Coverage without deductibles',
      'B) Lower premiums, tax-deductible HSA contributions, tax-free growth, and tax-free withdrawals for qualified medical expenses',
      'D) Employer-only contributions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'HDHP + HSA: triple tax advantage (deduction, tax-free growth, tax-free qualified withdrawals). HDHPs have minimum deductibles ($1,600 individual/$3,200 family in 2024) and maximum out-of-pocket limits. HSA contributions for 2024: $4,150/$8,300 + $1,000 catch-up (55+). HSA funds roll over and can be invested for retirement.'

      'D) Free coverage',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'COBRA applies to employers with 20+ employees. Qualifying events: job loss (18 months), hours reduction (18 months), divorce/legal separation (36 months), death (36 months for dependents), Medicare eligibility (36 months for spouse), dependent aging out (36 months). Premium is full cost plus 2% admin fee.'

      'A) Only hospital stays',
      'D) Long-term care',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Medicare: Part A (hospital—generally premium-free), Part B (medical/outpatient—premium required), Part C (Medicare Advantage—private plans combining A, B, usually D), Part D (prescription drugs—separate or with Advantage). Original Medicare (A+B) can add Medigap and standalone Part D. Medicare doesn\'t cover long-term care.'

    question: 'Loss prevention differs from loss reduction in that prevention:',
    options: [
      'C) Is more expensive',
      'B) Aims to avoid losses from occurring, while reduction minimizes loss severity once an event happens',
      'A) Minimizes loss severity',
      'D) Only applies to health risks',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Loss prevention stops losses (smoke alarms, safe driving, exercise). Loss reduction minimizes severity (sprinklers limit fire damage, seatbelts reduce injury severity, first aid). Both are risk control techniques that complement insurance. Prevention is proactive; reduction is reactive planning.'

      'D) Conversion to term insurance',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Guaranteed insurability (or purchase option) lets policyholders buy additional coverage at specific dates (policy anniversaries) or life events (marriage, birth) without medical underwriting. Lock in insurability while young/healthy for future needs. Coverage is at attained age rates, but without health requirements.'

      'A) Is the same as residual disability',
      'D) Reduces premiums',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Recovery benefits continue for a period after total disability ends, even at full earning capacity. They help with transition expenses—new clothing after weight change, work equipment, training, deferred personal expenses. Typically 12-24 months, decreasing monthly. Different from residual (which requires ongoing income loss).'

      'C) Is always cheaper',
      'D) Doesn\'t include exclusions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Named peril: only listed causes of loss covered (fire, lightning, windstorm, etc.). Open peril: covers any cause of loss unless specifically excluded (nuclear, war, intentional, etc.). Open peril is broader—unexpected events not listed as exclusions are covered. Standard homeowners policies vary: dwelling is often open peril; contents may be named peril.'

      'C) Have no time limits',
      'D) Are always more expensive'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Occurrence: covers incidents during policy period regardless of when claim is made. Claims-made: covers claims made during policy period for incidents after the retroactive date. Claims-made requires tail coverage (extended reporting period) when policies lapse to cover future claims from past acts. Professional liability is typically claims-made.'

      'Both Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans are identical in structure and coverage',
      'Medigap plans are only available to those under age 65',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Medigap (Medicare Supplement) plans work alongside Original Medicare to cover deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans replace Original Medicare with managed care plans (HMO/PPO) that provide all Part A and B benefits plus often Part D and additional benefits.',

      'D) Voiding coverage for major claims',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Coinsurance: if coverage is less than the required % of value (usually 80%), claims are reduced proportionally. Formula: (Coverage carried / Coverage required) × Loss = Payment. Example: $160K coverage on $250K home (64% vs. 80% required), $50K loss: (160/200) × 50K = $40K payment (20% penalty). Ensures adequate coverage for premium calculations.'
