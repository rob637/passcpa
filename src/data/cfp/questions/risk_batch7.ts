    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A risk matrix evaluates potential losses by considering:',
    options: [
      'A) Only probability of occurrence',
      'D) Historical claims data exclusively',
      'B) Both the probability of occurrence and the severity of potential loss to prioritize risk management responses',
      'C) Insurance premium costs only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Risk matrix: plots probability (likelihood) vs. severity (impact). High probability/high severity: priority for risk transfer (insurance). Low probability/high severity: catastrophic—insurance essential. High probability/low severity: may self-insure with reserves. Low/low: accept the risk. Helps allocate limited risk management resources effectively.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Pure risk involves only the possibility of loss or no loss — there is no potential gain. Property damage from a hurricane is a pure risk because the only outcomes are loss (damage occurs) or no loss (no damage). Speculative risks like investing or starting a business include the possibility of gain.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
