    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Risk retention (self-insurance) is most appropriate when:',
    options: [
      'C) There is no other option',
      'A) The loss would be catastrophic',
      'D) Insurance is always unavailable',
      'B) The potential loss is small relative to financial resources, the risk occurs frequently, or insurance costs exceed expected losses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Risk retention suitable when: loss small and affordable (high deductibles), frequent losses make insurance expensive (claims experience), premium exceeds expected loss value, or loss is uninsurable. Requires adequate reserves. Not appropriate for catastrophic risks. Conscious decision, not just lack of coverage. Many businesses retain smaller risks strategically.'
