    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'For travel expense deduction purposes, a taxpayer\'s "tax home" is:',
    options: [
      'D) Where they pay the most taxes',
      'B) The area of their regular place of business, regardless of where their personal residence is located',
      'A) Where they live',
      'C) Their state of residence',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Tax home: your regular place of business (main work location), not necessarily where you live. Travel expenses are deductible when away from tax home overnight for business. If no regular place of business, tax home may be personal residence. Transient workers may have no tax home, making travel expenses non-deductible.'

Use-it-or-lose-it (some employers allow grace period or carryover up to $500). Reduces AGI. Coordinates with child care credit—can\'t use same expenses for both.'

      'D) Premium increases at maturity',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Bond premium (cost > par): can elect to amortize annually. Reduces interest income (prefer for taxable bonds) and reduces basis.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Crummey powers: beneficiary has limited time (typically 30 days) to withdraw contributed amount. This makes gift a present interest (qualifies for annual exclusion) rather than future interest. Without Crummey power, gifts to irrevocable trusts would use lifetime exemption. Power usually lapses unused. Commonly used in ILITs for premium payments. Named after Crummey v. Commissioner.'
