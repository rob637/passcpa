    question: 'A married couple filing jointly has taxable income of $85,000 including $20,000 of long-term capital gains. What rate applies to their capital gains (2026)?',
    options: [
      'A) 0%',
      'B) 15%',
      'D) Blended 0%/15%',
      'C) 20%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The 0% capital gains bracket ends around $94,050 for MFJ in 2026. Ordinary income of $65,000 plus $20,000 gains = $85,000 total. Some gains fall in the 0% bracket (up to ~$94,050), remainder at 15%. The $20,000 stacks on top of ordinary income, creating a blended rate.'

      'A) Short-term (held exactly 1 year)',
      'C) Depends on the type of stock',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The holding period begins the day after purchase (March 16, 2026). To be long-term, the asset must be held MORE than one year. Sold on March 16, 2027 = held from March 16, 2026 to March 16, 2027 = exactly 1 year and 1 day = long-term capital gain.'

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'NIIT = 3.8% on the lesser of (1) net investment income or (2) MAGI above threshold. Single threshold is $200,000. MAGI above threshold = $250,000 - $200,000 = $50,000. NII = $60,000. Lesser amount = $50,000. NIIT = $50,000 × 3.8% = $1,900.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'QSBS acquired after September 27, 2010 qualifies for 100% exclusion of gain (up to $10 million or 10x basis). Earlier acquisition dates have lower exclusions (50% or 75%). The excluded gain is not subject to AMT preference for 100% exclusion stock.'

    options: [
      'A) Loss is fully deductible in December',
      'D) Half the loss is deductible',
      'B) Loss is disallowed; basis increases in new shares',
      'C) Loss is deductible; this is outside the wash sale window',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The wash sale rule disallows a loss if substantially identical securities are purchased within 30 days before or after the sale. December 15 + 30 days = January 14. Purchase on January 10 is within the window. Loss is disallowed but added to the basis of the new shares.'

      'D) No benefit on QOF appreciation; only original gain is deferred',
      'C) Appreciation taxed at 15% rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'If a QOF investment is held 10+ years, any appreciation in the QOF itself is permanently excludable from income. The original deferred gain is recognized in 2026 (or earlier sale). The 10% and 15% basis step-ups for 5-7 year holds expired after 2026 for gains already invested.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Adjusted basis = $400,000 - $50,000 depreciation = $350,000. Total gain = $500,000 - $350,000 = $150,000. Unrecaptured Section 1250 gain = accumulated depreciation = $50,000, taxed at max 25%. Remaining $100,000 is Section 1231 gain (typically long-term capital gain rates).'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Gross profit = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000. Gross profit percentage = $300,000 / $400,000 = 75%. Each $80,000 payment × 75% = $60,000 taxable gain, $20,000 return of basis. This applies to each of the five payments ($80,000 down + 4 installments).'

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Section 121 requires 2 out of 5 years ownership AND use, PLUS the exclusion cannot have been used in the prior 2 years. Since they used it 18 months ago (less than 2 years), no current exclusion is available. The full $600,000 gain is taxable (15%/20% LTCG rate + possible NIIT).'

    explanation: 'GST tax is a flat 40% on transfers to skip persons (grandchildren or below). The GST exemption mirrors the gift/estate exemption (approximately $7 million in 2026 post-TCJA sunset). Exempt transfers multiply through generations without additional transfer tax.'

    question: 'A grandparent contributes $19,000 to a trust for a grandchild to receive at age 30 (currently age 5). How much qualifies for the annual exclusion without Crummey powers?',
    options: [
      'D) $19,000',
      'A) $0',
      'B) $9,500',
      'C) $15,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Without a present interest (right to immediate use/possession), no annual exclusion applies to gifts of future interests. The grandchild cannot access funds until age 30—this is a future interest. Crummey withdrawal powers or 2503(c) trust provisions would create present interest.'
