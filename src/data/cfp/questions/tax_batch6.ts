    subtopic: 'AMT',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'Common adjustments that may trigger Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) include:',
    options: [
      'B) State and local taxes, ISO exercise bargain element, and certain interest deductions',
      'D) Social Security benefits and pension income',
      'C) 401(k) contributions and HSA contributions',
      'A) Standard deduction and charitable contributions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'AMT adds back certain "preference items" including state and local tax deductions, the spread on ISO exercise, certain mortgage interest, and investment interest. TCJA reduced AMT impact by increasing exemption amounts and limiting SALT deductions to $10,000, which reduced the AMT preference.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Under the "kiddie tax" rules, a 17-year-old dependent child\'s unearned income above $2,500 (2024) is taxed at:',
    options: [
      'B) A flat 15% rate',
      'D) Zero—unearned income is not taxable for minors',
      'C) The parents\' marginal tax rate',
      'A) The child\'s own tax rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The kiddie tax applies to children under 19 (or under 24 if full-time students). Unearned income above the threshold is taxed at the parents\' marginal rate. This prevents shifting investment income to children to take advantage of their lower tax brackets. Applies to interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.'

Strategies include timing income, maximizing deductions, and shifting income to non-investment sources when possible.'

      'D) A stepped-up basis in trust assets',
      'A) An immediate full deduction for the property donated',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,

      'D) Tax deductions exceeding the value of contributions',
      'A) Tax deduction when grants are made to charity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'DAFs provide an immediate tax deduction when funds are contributed (cash or appreciated securities). The donor then recommends grants to charities over time. This separates the tax benefit from the charitable timing, useful for bunching deductions or having a high-income year.'

    explanation: 'TCJA suspended personal casualty loss deductions except for losses from federally declared disasters. Qualified disaster losses are deductible subject to the $100 per-event floor and 10% of AGI threshold. Business casualty losses remain fully deductible. It\'s critical to check if an area qualifies.'

      'B) Spread the recognition of gain over the payment period as payments are received',
      'A) Defer all gain indefinitely',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Installment sales spread gain recognition over the payment period using the gross profit percentage applied to each payment. This defers taxes but requires interest charges on the deferred balance. Depreciation recapture and inventory are ineligible. Related party sales have special rules.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'TCJA limited §1031 to real property only, eliminating like-kind treatment for personal property. Real estate held for business or investment qualifies for tax deferral. The 45-day identification and 180-day closing deadlines must be followed. Boot received triggers gain recognition.'

      'C) Guaranteed returns in distressed communities',
      'A) Immediate tax deduction for the investment amount',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Investing capital gains in a Qualified Opportunity Fund defers the original gain until 2026 or sale. If held 10+ years, gains on the QOF investment itself are excluded from income. The basis step-up benefits previously available for 5/7-year holdings have expired. Only capital gains qualify.'

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'S corps must have 100 or fewer shareholders (certain family members counted as one), one class of stock, domestic corporation, eligible shareholders (individuals, certain trusts, estates—not partnerships or corporations).

      'C) A flat 10% tax regardless of income level',
      'A) Only the 12.4% Social Security portion',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Self-employed individuals pay 15.3% SE tax (equivalent to both employer and employee FICA shares) on 92.35% of net self-employment income. Social Security applies up to the wage base ($168,600 in 2024); Medicare has no cap plus 0.9% surtax on high earners. Half of SE tax is deductible for income tax purposes.'

Above these limits, the deduction phases out and is eliminated at higher incomes. Non-SSTBs face W-2 wage and property limitations instead.'

      'C) 85% of current year tax',
      'D) 50% of current year tax',
      'A) 100% of current year tax or 80% of prior year',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,

Payments can be made via withholding or quarterly estimates. Withholding is treated as paid ratably throughout the year.'

      'B) Converting Traditional IRA funds to Roth up to the bracket limit to "fill the bracket"',

      'D) Making no changes—bracket management provides minimal benefit',
      'A) Accelerating all income possible into the current year',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: '"Filling the bracket" involves recognizing income (Roth conversions, capital gains, etc.) up to the top of a favorable bracket. If income will be higher in future years, paying 22% now on Roth conversions may be better than 24%+ later. This is especially valuable if tax rates are expected to increase.'

      'A) They are real estate professionals',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Active participation (lower standard than material participation) in rental real estate allows up to $25,000 of losses against non-passive income. This phases out between $100K-$150K AGI. Real estate professionals meeting 750-hour rules can treat rentals as non-passive. Otherwise, passive losses offset only passive income.'
