      'A) It always generates losses',
      'D) Expenses exceed $10,000',
      'C) The taxpayer enjoys the activity',
      'B) It shows a profit in 3 of the last 5 tax years (2 of 7 for horse activities)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The 3-of-5 presumption (2-of-7 for horses) helps establish profit motive. If classified as a hobby, losses cannot offset other income (after TCJA). Nine factors are considered including time/effort, manner conducted, expertise, and history of income. The presumption can be rebutted by the IRS.'

      'B) Taxpayers are not taxed on the return of their own investment, only on amounts exceeding basis',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Recovery of capital means you don\'t pay tax on getting your own money back. If you sell stock bought for $10,000 at $15,000, only $5,000 is taxable—the $10,000 is return of capital. This applies to annuity exclusion ratios, installment sales, and partnership distributions.'

      'C) Alimony is tax-free to both parties',
      'B) Alimony is neither deductible by the payer nor taxable to the recipient',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'TCJA eliminated the alimony deduction for agreements executed after 12/31/2018. The payer gets no deduction; the recipient pays no tax. Pre-2019 agreements retain the old deductible/taxable treatment unless modified to specify otherwise. Child support was never deductible/taxable.'

    options: [
      'D) Only upon sale of property',
      'C) The taxpayer files their return',
      'A) Income is actually received',
      'B) A taxpayer receives an economic benefit that is the equivalent of cash, even without actual receipt',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Economic benefit triggers taxation when the taxpayer has a right to property or services that has ascertainable value, even without actual receipt. Examples include employer-purchased life insurance over $50,000 and certain funded deferred compensation. It prevents deferral when economic value is received.'

      'C) Charge a penalty only',

      'A) Ignore the interest rate',
      'B) Impute interest at the Applicable Federal Rate, treating it as income to the lender and potentially a gift to the borrower',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Below-market loans trigger imputed interest under IRC Section 7872. Interest calculated at AFR is treated as paid by borrower and received by lender (taxable interest income). For gift loans, the lender makes a deemed gift of the foregone interest. Exceptions exist for small loans under $10,000 or $100,000 without investment income offset.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Excess business loss rules limit the net business loss deduction for non-corporate taxpayers (amounts adjusted annually for inflation). Disallowed losses become NOL carryforwards. This applies after at-risk and passive loss limitations. CARES Act suspended then reinstated the rules.'

      'B) Losses on qualifying small business stock to be treated as ordinary losses up to $50,000 ($100,000 MFJ) per year',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Section 1244 provides significant tax benefits for investing in small businesses. Losses are ordinary (fully deductible against ordinary income) rather than capital ($3,000 annual limit). The stock must be issued for money or property to an individual, with corporate capitalization under $1 million. Gains remain capital.'

      'A) Is never deductible',
      'D) Is limited to $3,000',
      'B) Is an ordinary loss equal to the property\'s adjusted basis',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Abandonment creates an ordinary loss (not capital) for the property\'s remaining basis. Unlike sale (which can be capital gain/loss), abandonment is ordinary because there\'s no sale or exchange. The loss is claimed in the year of permanent abandonment—intent plus overt act of abandonment must be demonstrated.'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'A taxpayer with $5,000 of foreign taxes paid and $100,000 of worldwide taxable income ($20,000 foreign, $80,000 U.S.) with a U.S. tax of $20,000 can claim a foreign tax credit of:',
    options: [
      'A) $5,000',
      'D) $0',
      'C) $20,000',
      'B) $4,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'FTC limitation = U.S. Tax × (Foreign Income ÷ Worldwide Income) = $20,000 × ($20,000 ÷ $100,000) = $4,000. Though $5,000 was paid, only $4,000 can be claimed this year. The excess $1,000 can carry back 1 year or forward 10 years. The credit prevents double taxation of foreign income.'

      'C) Is a revocable trust',
      'B) Transfers a home to beneficiaries at a reduced gift tax value while the grantor retains the right to live there for a term of years',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'QPRTs freeze the home\'s value for estate tax purposes. The grantor gifts the home but retains occupancy for a term. The gift value is discounted based on term length and interest rates. If the grantor survives the term, the home passes to beneficiaries outside the estate. Early death nullifies the benefit.'

      'B) Multiple factors including intent to remain permanently, location of family, voter registration, driver\'s license, and time spent',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'States examine intent and objective factors: where you vote, hold licenses, bank, keep valuables, have professional ties, spend time, belong to organizations, and where family resides. Domicile can only be in one place and requires intent to make it your permanent home. This becomes important when moving to low/no-tax states.'

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'If you deducted an expense (getting a tax benefit) and later recover that amount, the recovery is taxable income. Examples: deducted bad debt later recovered, state tax refund after itemizing in prior year. If the original deduction provided no benefit (standard deduction used), recovery isn\'t taxable.'

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'CRTs provide current deduction based on present value of future charitable gift, income stream from trust assets, and removal of assets from estate. When funded with appreciated property, capital gains are avoided at contribution. Remainder (minimum 10% of initial value) goes to charity. Income is taxed to beneficiary under tier rules.'

    explanation: 'Innocent spouse relief (IRC 6015) separates one spouse from liability when the other created the tax problem unknowingly. Requirements include: joint return filed, understatement due to erroneous items of the other spouse, didn\'t know and had no reason to know, and it\'s inequitable to hold liable. Separation of liability is an alternative.'
