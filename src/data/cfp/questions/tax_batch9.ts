    topic: 'Income Tax',
    subtopic: 'Assignment of Income',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'The assignment of income doctrine means that:',
    options: [
      'A) Income can be freely shifted to any taxpayer',
      'D) Employers assign income amounts',
      'B) Income is taxed to the person who earns it or owns the income-producing property, regardless of who receives payment',
      'C) Family income is always split equally',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Assignment of income prevents tax avoidance through income shifting. You can\'t assign earned income to a lower-bracket family member—it\'s taxed to the earner. Property income is taxed to the owner. To shift income, you must transfer the underlying property. Lucas v. Earl and Helvering v. Horst are landmark cases.'

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'In community property states, income earned during marriage:',
    options: [
      'D) Is always taxed separately',
      'A) Belongs entirely to the earner',
      'B) Is generally owned equally by both spouses regardless of who earned it',
      'C) Goes to the higher earner',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Community property states (CA, TX, WA, etc.): earnings and property acquired during marriage are owned 50/50. This affects taxation (especially on MFS returns), estate planning (automatic 50% ownership), and divorce (equal division). Separate property (pre-marriage, inheritance, gifts) remains individually owned.'

    question: 'Constructive receipt means income is taxable when:',
    options: [
      'B) The taxpayer has an unrestricted right to receive it, even if not actually received',
      'A) Payment is in hand',
      'D) The employer reports it',
      'C) The tax return is filed',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Constructive receipt: income is taxable when available without substantial limitations, not when actually received. A year-end bonus available December 31 but not picked up until January is December income. "Substantial limitations" (risk of forfeiture, not yet earned) can defer recognition.'

      'C) Increased significantly',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'TCJA eliminated the employee home office deduction through 2025 (unreimbursed employee expenses formerly under miscellaneous itemized deductions). Self-employed can still deduct using simplified method ($5/sq ft, max 300 sq ft) or actual expense proration. Space must be exclusively and regularly used for business.'

Requirements: ordinary and necessary expense, not lavish, taxpayer or employee present, substantiation (amount, date, place, business purpose, relationship). Entertainment expenses are generally not deductible post-TCJA.'

      'C) Has no income limits',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Credit for care enabling work: qualifying child under 13 or disabled dependent/spouse. Expenses limited to $3K (one) or $6K (two+).

      'A) 0/15/20% rates like stocks',
      'C) Ordinary income rates',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Collectibles gains: maximum 28% (vs. 0/15/20% for most LTCG). This includes art, antiques, gems, stamps, coins, precious metals, and most importantly for planning—gains on gold/precious metals ETFs holding physical metals. Some collectibles in self-directed IRAs trigger UBIT. Higher rate reduces after-tax returns.'

    options: [
      'A) Investing in stocks only',
      'D) Only for professional traders',
      'B) Holding offsetting positions that reduce risk, potentially limiting loss recognition and requiring interest capitalization',
      'C) Selling within 30 days',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Straddle rules prevent recognizing losses on one leg while continuing to hold offsetting gain positions. If positions substantially diminish risk (opposite market directions, same underlying), losses may be deferred, holding period suspended, and interest/carrying costs capitalized. Complex rules affect options, commodities, and some equity strategies.'

    options: [
      'A) Are not taxable until shares are sold',
      'D) Are always tax-free',
      'B) Are taxable in the year received, with reinvested amount becoming additional cost basis',
      'C) Reduce dividend income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'DRIP dividends are taxable when received—reinvestment doesn\'t defer tax. The dividend amount becomes cost basis in new shares. This creates phantom income (taxes without cash) in taxable accounts. Keep records of reinvested amounts for accurate basis calculation when selling. DRIPs are fine in tax-deferred accounts.'

      'B) Immediate deduction of qualifying property costs (up to $1.16M in 2024), limited to business income',
      'C) Unlimited expensing',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Section 179: expense qualifying property (equipment, some software, qualified improvements) instead of depreciating. 2024 limit: $1,160,000, phasing out when purchases exceed $2.89M. Limited to taxable income from active business. Can be combined with bonus depreciation. Enables significant first-year deductions for capital purchases.'

    options: [
      'A) All businesses equally',
      'D) Real estate exclusively',
      'B) Service businesses like law, accounting, and consulting, which lose the deduction as taxable income exceeds thresholds',
      'C) Only manufacturers',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'SSTBs (health, law, accounting, actuarial, performing arts, consulting, athletics, financial services, brokerage) have stricter limits. Above thresholds ($191,950 single/$383,900 MFJ in 2024), the QBI deduction phases out completely—no W-2/capital limitation helps. Non-SSTB businesses can still qualify using W-2 wages or property limits above thresholds.'

    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Reasonable compensation issues arise for S corporation owner-employees because:',
    options: [
      'A) Salaries are not deductible',
      'B) Salary is subject to employment taxes while distributions are not—IRS scrutinizes inadequate salaries',
      'D) S corps cannot pay dividends',
      'C) All income is wages',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'S corp owners must take reasonable salary (subject to FICA) before receiving distributions (not subject to FICA). Low salary/high distribution saves payroll taxes but is audit risk. IRS examines industry norms, responsibilities, experience. The spread between reasonable salary and pure distributions represents legitimate planning; zero salary is never acceptable.'

    topic: 'Estate/Gift Tax',
    subtopic: 'Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax',
    difficulty: 'hard',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax applies to:',
    options: [
      'B) Transfers to skip persons (typically grandchildren or trusts for them) above the GST exemption, at a flat 40% rate',
      'A) All gifts to grandchildren',
      'D) Transfers under $100,000',
      'C) Only testamentary transfers',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'GST prevents avoiding estate tax by skipping generations. Skip persons: those two or more generations below (grandchildren unless parent deceased). Three types: direct skip (outright gift), taxable termination (trust interest ends), taxable distribution (distribution from trust). 40% flat rate, with exemption equal to estate exemption ($13.61M in 2024).'

    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Gift splitting allows married couples to:',
    options: [
      'D) Reduce estate size immediately',
      'B) Elect to treat a gift from one spouse as made half by each, doubling the annual exclusion available per donee',
      'A) Avoid all gift tax',
      'C) Only give to spouses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Gift splitting (IRC 2513): with spouse consent, gifts can be treated as 50% from each spouse. This doubles annual exclusion ($18K × 2 = $36K per donee in 2024) and potentially uses both unified credits. Requires spouse consent on gift return. Both spouses must be U.S. citizens/residents. Simple strategy to maximize gift-tax-free giving.'

      'C) Always excluded',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Debt forgiveness = income (you received cash/benefit, now don\'t have to repay). Exceptions: discharge in bankruptcy (Title 11), insolvency (to extent insolvent), qualified farm/business debt, qualified principal residence debt (extended through 2025). Excluded amounts may reduce tax attributes (losses, basis). Form 1099-C reports cancellations over $600.'

      'C) Without any limitations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Self-employed health insurance deduction is above-the-line (reducing AGI regardless of itemizing). Limited to net self-employment income. Covers self, spouse, dependents, and children under 27. Cannot use if eligible for employer-subsidized plan. Does NOT reduce self-employment tax base—only income tax. Important distinction from business expense.'

      'C) Only capitalized, never deducted',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Start-up costs (investigating, creating a business before it begins): $5,000 immediate deduction, reduced dollar-for-dollar for costs over $50,000. Remaining costs amortize over 180 months starting with business month. Organizational costs (legal/state fees for entity) have same treatment.

IRS has ruled no "clawback" of gifts using higher exemption. This creates a planning window—clients should consider using exemption through gifts or irrevocable trusts before potential reduction.'
