## IS Audit Standards & Guidelines

### ISACA Standards Hierarchy
1. **Standards** - Mandatory requirements
2. **Guidelines** - Guidance on applying standards
3. **Tools & Techniques** - Specific methodologies

### Key Standards
| Standard | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| S1-S17 | Audit charter, independence, competence, planning, evidence, reporting |

---

## Audit Planning

### Risk-Based Audit Planning
1. Understand business objectives
2. Identify IT assets & processes
3. Assess inherent risk
4. Evaluate control environment
5. Determine residual risk
6. Prioritize audit resources

### Audit Universe
- Complete inventory of auditable entities
- Updated annually
- Basis for audit plan

### Key Planning Documents
| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Audit Charter | Authority & responsibility |
| Audit Plan | Annual schedule & priorities |
| Audit Program | Detailed procedures for engagement |

---

## Audit Evidence

### Evidence Characteristics (RASC)
- **Reliable** - Trustworthy source
- **Relevant** - Relates to objective
- **Sufficient** - Quantity adequate
- **Competent** - Quality appropriate

### Evidence Types (Most to Least Reliable)
1. Physical observation
2. Documentary (external)
3. Documentary (internal)
4. Oral representations

### Evidence Gathering Techniques
| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Inquiry | Interviews/questioning |
| Observation | Watching processes |
| Inspection | Examining documents |
| Re-performance | Independently executing |
| Confirmation | Third-party verification |

---

## Sampling Methods

### Statistical Sampling
- **Attribute** - Testing for yes/no (control present)
- **Variable** - Testing for values (amounts)

### Sample Size Factors
| Factor | Larger Sample If |
|--------|-----------------|
| Confidence Level | Higher confidence needed |
| Population Size | Larger population |
| Expected Error | Higher expected errors |
| Tolerable Error | Lower tolerance |

### Non-Statistical Sampling
- Judgmental - Auditor selects based on experience
- Haphazard - Random without formal process

---

## CAATs (Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques)

### Common CAATs
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| GAS (Generalized Audit Software) | Data analysis |
| Test Data | Validate processing logic |
| ITF (Integrated Test Facility) | Test with live data |
| Parallel Simulation | Re-process data |
| Embedded Audit Modules | Continuous capture |

### When to Use CAATs
- Large data volumes
- Complex calculations
- Repetitive processes
- Continuous auditing

---

## Control Testing

### Types of Controls
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Preventive | Stop errors before | Access controls |
| Detective | Identify errors after | Exception reports |
| Corrective | Fix identified errors | Backup restore |

### Control Testing Approaches
1. **Walkthrough** - Trace transaction through process
2. **Inquiry** - Ask about control operation
3. **Observation** - Watch control in action
4. **Re-performance** - Execute control independently
5. **Inspection** - Review evidence of control

### IT General Controls (ITGCs)
- Access security
- Change management
- IT operations
- SDLC controls

---

## Audit Reporting

### Finding Elements (CCCR)
- **Criteria** - Standard/expectation
- **Condition** - What was found
- **Cause** - Why it occurred
- **Recommendation** - How to fix

### Report Types
| Type | When Used |
|------|-----------|
| Qualified | Material weakness exists |
| Unqualified | No significant issues |
| Adverse | Pervasive weaknesses |
| Disclaimer | Insufficient evidence |

---

## Follow-Up

### Follow-Up Process
1. Track management responses
2. Monitor remediation progress
3. Validate completed actions
4. Escalate overdue items
5. Report to audit committee

### Management Response Requirements
- Agree/disagree with finding
- Action plan
- Responsible party
- Target date

---

## Professional Ethics

### ISACA Code of Ethics
1. Support implementation of standards
2. Act in stakeholders' interest
3. Maintain professional competence
4. Maintain confidentiality
5. Perform duties objectively

### Independence Threats
| Threat | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Self-review | Auditing own work |
| Advocacy | Promoting auditee |
| Familiarity | Long tenure |
| Intimidation | Management pressure |
| Self-interest | Financial relationship |

---

## Quick Reference Formulas

### Sample Size (Attribute)
```
n = (Confidence Factor × Population) / (Tolerable Error Rate × Population)
```

### Confidence Levels
| Level | Factor |
|-------|--------|
| 90% | 2.31 |
| 95% | 3.00 |
| 99% | 4.61 |

## Exam Tips - Domain 1

1. **Always prioritize risk-based approach**
2. **Independence is NON-NEGOTIABLE**
3. **Evidence quality > quantity**
4. **Document EVERYTHING**
5. **Follow-up is mandatory, not optional**
6. **When in doubt, choose the most OBJECTIVE option**
