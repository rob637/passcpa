    question: 'An IS auditor inspecting the data center observes that the server room door uses only a standard key lock with no logging capability. What physical security improvement should be recommended FIRST?',
    options: [
      'Installing security cameras in the parking lot',
      'Implementing electronic access control with badge readers that log all entry and exit events with timestamps and individual identification',
      'Hiring additional security guards for the building perimeter',
      'Painting the server room door a different color for visibility',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Electronic access control with badge readers provides individual identification, real-time access logging, time-based restrictions, and the ability to revoke access remotely. Key locks cannot identify who entered, have no audit trail, and require costly re-keying when keys are lost or personnel change.',
