    question: 'An IS auditor finds that scheduled maintenance windows for critical systems are not communicated to business stakeholders in advance. What is the PRIMARY concern?',
    options: [
      'IT staff may be unavailable during maintenance windows',

      'Maintenance windows will take longer than planned',
      'Change advisory board meetings will be cancelled',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Failure to communicate scheduled maintenance windows to business stakeholders can result in unexpected service disruptions, data loss from unsaved work, failed batch processing jobs, and frustrated users. Advance communication allows business units to plan around the downtime and prepare contingencies.',
