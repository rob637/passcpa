## Framework Summary

| Framework | Focus | Origin |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| COBIT | IT Governance | ISACA |
| ITIL | IT Service Management | UK Government/Axelos |
| ISO 27001 | Information Security | ISO |
| NIST CSF | Cybersecurity | US Government |

## COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)

### Purpose
Enterprise IT governance and management framework - aligns IT with business objectives.

### COBIT 2019 Structure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Governance Objectives | EDM (Evaluate, Direct, Monitor) |
| Management Objectives | APO, BAI, DSS, MEA |
| Design Factors | Enterprise-specific customization |
| Focus Areas | Specific governance topics |

### COBIT Domains

| Domain | Code | Focus |
|--------|------|-------|
| Evaluate, Direct, Monitor | EDM | Governance |
| Align, Plan, Organize | APO | Strategic alignment |
| Build, Acquire, Implement | BAI | Solution development |
| Deliver, Service, Support | DSS | Daily operations |
| Monitor, Evaluate, Assess | MEA | Performance monitoring |

### Key Principles
1. Meeting stakeholder needs
2. Covering enterprise end-to-end
3. Applying single integrated framework
4. Enabling holistic approach
5. Separating governance from management

| People | 8 controls |
| Physical | 14 controls |
| Technological | 34 controls |

### Certification
- Certification audit by accredited body
- Surveillance audits annually
- Recertification every 3 years

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

### Purpose
Voluntary framework for managing cybersecurity risk - widely adopted in US.

### Core Functions

| Function | Code | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| Identify | ID | Asset management, risk |
| Protect | PR | Safeguards |
| Detect | DE | Detection activities |
| Respond | RS | Incident response |
| Recover | RC | Recovery planning |

**Memory Aid**: "I Prefer Delicious Ripe Raspberries"

### Implementation Tiers

| Tier | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Partial | Ad hoc, reactive |
| 2 | Risk Informed | Risk aware, not org-wide |
| 3 | Repeatable | Formal policies, org-wide |
| 4 | Adaptive | Continuous improvement |

## When to Use Each

| Scenario | Framework |
|----------|-----------|
| Aligning IT with business | COBIT |
| Managing IT services | ITIL |
| Security certification needed | ISO 27001 |
| US regulatory environment | NIST CSF |
| SOX compliance | COBIT + ISO |
| Service desk improvement | ITIL |

---

## CISA Exam Focus

### Most Tested Concepts
1. **COBIT**: Domains, governance vs management
2. **ITIL**: Incident vs problem, change management
3. **ISO 27001**: Certification process, Annex A
4. **NIST**: Five functions, tiers

### Common Questions
- Framework selection for scenarios
- Mapping controls to frameworks
- Governance vs management distinction
- Incident vs problem management
