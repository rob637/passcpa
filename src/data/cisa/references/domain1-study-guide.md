# CISA Domain 1: Information Systems Auditing Process (18%)

## Overview

Domain 1 covers the IS audit process from planning through reporting. This domain tests your ability to plan and execute IS audits using risk-based approaches, ISACA standards, and proper evidence collection techniques.

## Key Weight

**18% of the exam** - Expect approximately 27 questions.

## Domain 1A: IS Audit Planning

### Risk-Based Audit Planning

Audits should focus resources on areas of greatest risk:

**Audit Risk Formula:**
\`\`\`
Audit Risk = Inherent Risk × Control Risk × Detection Risk
\`\`\`

- **Inherent Risk**: Risk before controls (nature of the business/system)
- **Control Risk**: Risk that controls fail to prevent/detect issues
- **Detection Risk**: Risk that audit procedures miss issues (only controllable by auditor)

### ISACA Standards and Guidelines

| Type | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Standards** | MANDATORY - must comply |
| **Guidelines** | RECOMMENDED - help implement standards |
| **Tools & Techniques** | OPTIONAL - practical assistance |

### Key Standards to Know

1. **Audit Charter** - Formal document defining audit authority, responsibility, and accountability
2. **Independence** - Must be independent in fact and appearance
3. **Due Professional Care** - Exercise professional skepticism and judgment
4. **Competence** - Maintain appropriate skills and knowledge

## Domain 1B: IS Audit Execution

### Audit Evidence (SCAR)

Evidence must be:
- **S**ufficient - Enough quantity to support conclusions
- **C**ompetent - Reliable and relevant
- **A**ppropriate - Fits the audit objective
- **R**elevant - Relates to the finding

### Evidence Reliability (Most to Least)

1. Physical observation
2. External documents (confirmations)
3. Internal documents
4. Auditor analysis
5. Oral representations

### Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs)

| Technique | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Generalized Audit Software (GAS)** | Data extraction and analysis | Large data analysis |
| **Test Data** | Process test transactions | Testing program logic |
| **Integrated Test Facility (ITF)** | Test data in production | Testing real processing |
| **Parallel Simulation** | Reprocess data with auditor software | Validating processing |

## Domain 1C: Control Self-Assessment (CSA)

### What is CSA?

Management and staff evaluate their own control environment.

### Benefits
- Improved risk awareness
- Employee buy-in
- Early problem detection
- Reduced audit time

### Limitations
- Potential bias
- Should complement, not replace, independent audit

---

## Domain 1D: Reporting and Follow-Up

### Five Cs of Audit Findings

Every finding should document:

1. **Condition** - What IS (the problem)
2. **Criteria** - What SHOULD BE (the standard)
3. **Cause** - WHY it happened (root cause)
4. **Consequence** - Business IMPACT (risk)
5. **Corrective Action** - HOW to fix it

### Audit Report Elements

- Executive summary
- Scope and objectives
- Findings and recommendations
- Management response
- Action plans with dates

### Follow-Up

- Verify corrective actions implemented
- Assess if remaining risk is acceptable
- Escalate to audit committee if needed

## Domain 1E: Control Frameworks

### COBIT (ISACA)

Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology:
- IT governance framework
- Aligns IT with business
- Provides metrics and maturity models

### COSO Components

1. **Control Environment** - Tone at the top
2. **Risk Assessment** - Identify and assess risks
3. **Control Activities** - Policies and procedures
4. **Information & Communication** - Relevant data flow
5. **Monitoring Activities** - Ongoing evaluation

### IT Controls

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **ITGCs** | General controls across IT | Access security, change management, operations |
| **Application Controls** | Specific to applications | Input validation, processing controls, output controls |

---

## Key Formulas & Memory Aids

### Audit Risk
\`\`\`
Audit Risk = Inherent × Control × Detection
\`\`\`
*Auditor controls Detection Risk by adjusting procedures*

### SCAR (Evidence Quality)
- Sufficient
- Competent
- Appropriate
- Relevant

### Five Cs (Findings)
- Condition
- Criteria
- Cause
- Consequence
- Corrective Action

## Exam Tips for Domain 1

1. **Independence is paramount** - When in doubt, independence wins
2. **Risk-based approach** - Always prioritize by risk
3. **Evidence from external sources** is more reliable than internal
4. **Standards are mandatory**, guidelines are recommended
5. **CSA supplements but doesn't replace** independent audit
6. **Document everything** - If it's not documented, it didn't happen
7. **Follow up** is critical - Ensure corrective actions are implemented

## Practice Questions Focus Areas

- Audit planning and risk assessment
- Evidence collection and evaluation
- CAATs selection and use
- Report writing and finding documentation
- Independence and ethics
- ISACA standards compliance
- Control framework knowledge (COBIT, COSO)
