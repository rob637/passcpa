## Section A: Financial Statement Analysis (20%)

### Profitability Ratios
| Ratio | Formula | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Gross Margin** | (Sales - COGS) / Sales | Markup efficiency |
| **Operating Margin** | Operating Income / Sales | Core operations |
| **Net Profit Margin** | Net Income / Sales | Bottom line |
| **ROA** | Net Income / Avg Assets | Asset efficiency |
| **ROE** | Net Income / Avg Equity | Shareholder return |
| **ROIC** | NOPAT / Invested Capital | Capital efficiency |

### DuPont Analysis
```
ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Financial Leverage
    = (NI/Sales) × (Sales/Assets) × (Assets/Equity)
```

**5-Factor DuPont**:
```
ROE = (EBIT/Sales) × (Sales/Assets) × (Assets/Equity) × (EBT/EBIT) × (NI/EBT)
      Tax Burden × Interest Burden × Operating Margin × Turnover × Leverage
```

### Liquidity Ratios
| Ratio | Formula | Target |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Current** | CA / CL | > 1.5-2.0 |
| **Quick** | (Cash + A/R + Securities) / CL | > 1.0 |
| **Cash** | Cash / CL | Context-dependent |

### Activity/Efficiency Ratios
| Ratio | Formula |
|-------|---------|
| **A/R Turnover** | Net Credit Sales / Avg A/R |
| **Days Sales Outstanding** | 365 / A/R Turnover |
| **Inventory Turnover** | COGS / Avg Inventory |
| **Days Inventory** | 365 / Inventory Turnover |
| **A/P Turnover** | Purchases / Avg A/P |
| **Days Payable** | 365 / A/P Turnover |
| **Cash Conversion Cycle** | DSO + DIO - DPO |

### Leverage Ratios
| Ratio | Formula | Meaning |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Debt-to-Equity** | Total Debt / Equity | Financial risk |
| **Debt-to-Assets** | Total Debt / Assets | Asset financing |
| **Interest Coverage** | EBIT / Interest Expense | Debt serviceability |
| **Fixed Charge** | (EBIT + Leases) / (Interest + Leases) | All fixed obligations |

---

## Section B: Corporate Finance (20%)

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
```
WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1-T))

Where:
E = Market value of equity
D = Market value of debt
V = E + D (total capital)
Re = Cost of equity
Rd = Cost of debt
T = Tax rate
```

### Cost of Equity Methods
| Method | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **CAPM** | Rf + β(Rm - Rf) |
| **DDM (Gordon)** | (D1 / P0) + g |
| **Bond Yield + Premium** | YTM + Equity Risk Premium (3-5%) |

### Net Present Value (NPV)
```
NPV = Σ [CFt / (1+r)^t] - Initial Investment

Accept if: NPV > 0
```

### Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Rate where NPV = 0
- **Accept if**: IRR > Required Rate
- **Limitation**: Multiple IRRs possible, assumes reinvestment at IRR

### Payback Period
```
Simple Payback = Years to recover investment
Discounted Payback = Years to recover at PV
```

### Modified IRR (MIRR)
- Assumes reinvestment at WACC (more realistic)
- Eliminates multiple IRR problem

### Profitability Index
```
PI = PV of Future Cash Flows / Initial Investment

Accept if: PI > 1.0
```

## Section C: Decision Analysis (25%)

### Relevant Cost Analysis
| Relevant | Not Relevant |
|----------|--------------|
| Future costs | Sunk costs |
| Differential costs | Committed costs |
| Opportunity costs | Allocated fixed costs |
| Avoidable costs | Non-cash charges (depreciation) |

### Make vs. Buy Decision
```
Relevant Costs to Make:
- Variable manufacturing costs
- Avoidable fixed costs
- Opportunity cost of capacity

Compare to: Purchase price + Any additional costs
```

### Special Order Pricing
```
Minimum Price = Variable Costs + Opportunity Cost
Accept if: Price ≥ Incremental Cost (when capacity exists)
```

### Keep vs. Drop Segment
```
Keep if: Contribution Margin > Avoidable Fixed Costs
Drop if: Avoidable Costs > Lost Contribution Margin
```

### CVP Analysis
| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| **Contribution Margin** | Sales - Variable Costs |
| **CM Ratio** | CM / Sales |
| **Break-even Units** | Fixed Costs / CM per Unit |
| **Break-even Dollars** | Fixed Costs / CM Ratio |
| **Target Profit Units** | (FC + Profit) / CM per Unit |
| **Margin of Safety** | Actual Sales - BE Sales |
| **Operating Leverage** | CM / Operating Income |

### Pricing Strategies
| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Cost-Plus** | Cost + Markup percentage |
| **Target Costing** | Target Price - Desired Profit = Allowable Cost |
| **Value-Based** | Based on customer perceived value |
| **Penetration** | Low price to gain market share |
| **Skimming** | High initial price, lower over time |
| **Transfer Pricing** | Intra-company transaction pricing |

### Transfer Pricing Methods
| Method | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| **Market Price** | External selling price |
| **Cost-Based** | Variable cost + Fixed cost markup |
| **Negotiated** | Between divisions |
| **Dual Pricing** | Different price for buyer/seller |

**Minimum Transfer Price** = Variable Cost + Opportunity Cost

## Section D: Risk Management (10%)

### Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)
**COSO ERM Framework**:
1. Governance & Culture
2. Strategy & Objective-Setting
3. Performance
4. Review & Revision
5. Information, Communication & Reporting

### Risk Categories
| Category | Examples |

| **Strategic** | Competition, market changes |
| **Operational** | Process failures, supply chain |
| **Financial** | Liquidity, credit, market |
| **Compliance** | Legal, regulatory |

## Section E: Investment Decisions (10%)

### Capital Structure
**Modigliani-Miller (MM)**:
- MM I (No Tax): Capital structure irrelevant
- MM II (With Tax): Debt adds value via tax shield

### Optimal Capital Structure
- Minimize WACC
- Balance tax benefits vs. financial distress costs
- Consider agency costs

### Working Capital Management
```
Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
Working Capital Cycle = DSO + DIO - DPO
```

### Cash Management
| Concept | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| **Economic Order Quantity** | √(2DS/H) |
| **Reorder Point** | Lead Time × Daily Usage |
| **Safety Stock** | Buffer for variability |

### Credit Policy Components
- Credit standards (who gets credit)
- Credit terms (payment timeline)
- Collection policy (enforcement)

### Credit Terms
Example: 2/10, n/30
- 2% discount if paid within 10 days
- Net due in 30 days

**Cost of Not Taking Discount**:
```
= (Discount % / (100 - Discount %)) × (365 / (Full Days - Discount Days))
= (2/98) × (365/20) = 37.2% APR
```
