    question: 'Jordan Manufacturing purchased 10,000 pounds of direct materials at $5.20 per pound. The standard price is $5.00 per pound. What is the materials price variance?',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Materials Price Variance = (Actual Price - Standard Price) × Actual Quantity Purchased\nMPV = ($5.20 - $5.00) × 10,000 = $0.20 × 10,000 = $2,000\nSince actual price exceeds standard, the variance is Unfavorable.',
