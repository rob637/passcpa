      'Change in accounting principle',
      'Prior period adjustments'

    question: 'A company has a contract to deliver 100 units at $50 each. After delivering 30 units, the contract is modified to add 20 units at $45 each (standalone price is $48). How should the modification be treated under ASC 606?',
    options: [
      'Always as a separate contract',
      'Always as a termination of the old contract',
      'Depends on whether the added goods are distinct and at standalone selling price',
      'Cumulative catch-up adjustment required'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Contract modification treatment depends on: (1) whether added goods are distinct, and (2) whether price reflects standalone selling prices. Since $45 < $48 (standalone price), this would NOT be treated as a separate contract—instead it would be combined with the existing contract.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Capitalize costs to bring asset to working condition: purchase price ($100,000) + shipping ($5,000) + installation ($8,000) = $113,000. Training costs ($3,000) are expensed—they benefit employees, not the asset.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'LIFO liquidation occurs when inventory units sold exceed units purchased, dipping into older, lower-cost layers. These lower historical costs matched against current revenues artificially inflate profits and may have tax consequences.',
