    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Application',
    question: 'Under ASC 842, a lessee classifies a lease as a finance lease when the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. What percentage is typically considered "major part"?',
    options: [
      '50% or more',
      '65% or more',
      '75% or more',
      '90% or more'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842, "major part" is generally interpreted as 75% or more of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset. This is one of the five criteria that, if met, would classify the lease as a finance lease rather than an operating lease.',

      'Identify separate performance obligations and allocate transaction price based on standalone selling prices',
      'Defer all revenue until the support period ends'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606, contracts with multiple performance obligations require identification of each distinct performance obligation. The transaction price is then allocated to each obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The software license and support services are likely separate obligations recognized at different times.',

    question: 'A company has inventory with an original cost of $100,000, replacement cost of $85,000, net realizable value of $90,000, and net realizable value less normal profit margin of $75,000. Under US GAAP, the inventory should be reported at:',

      '$85,000',
      '$90,000',
      '$100,000'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under US GAAP (ASC 330), inventory is reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). Since NRV of $90,000 is less than cost of $100,000, the inventory is written down to $90,000. The "ceiling and floor" constraints are no longer applicable under the simplified ASU 2015-11 guidance.',

    question: 'Under the simplified goodwill impairment test, a reporting unit has a carrying amount of $500,000 including goodwill of $120,000. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be $450,000. What amount of impairment loss should be recognized?',

      '$50,000',
      '$70,000',
      '$120,000'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the simplified one-step impairment test (ASU 2017-04), the impairment loss equals the excess of carrying amount over fair value, but is limited to the amount of goodwill. Here: $500,000 - $450,000 = $50,000 impairment. Since this is less than the $120,000 goodwill balance, the full $50,000 is recognized as impairment.',

    explanation: 'For a finance lease, there is no initial cash outflow at inception (the asset and liability are recognized). Subsequent lease payments are split: the principal reduction is reported as financing activity, while the interest portion is reported as operating activity (or financing, by policy choice under ASC 842).',

      'It is faster and requires less management time',
      'It forces justification of all activities, not just changes',
      'It automatically adjusts for inflation',
      'It eliminates the need for variance analysis'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Zero-based budgeting requires managers to justify every dollar of budget from zero, rather than starting from last year\'s budget. This forces critical evaluation of all activities and can eliminate wasteful spending that becomes embedded in incremental budgets. However, it is more time-consuming.',

    question: 'A regression analysis of maintenance costs (Y) and machine hours (X) yields: Y = $15,000 + $3.50X with R² = 0.85. If planned machine hours are 8,000, what is the predicted maintenance cost and how reliable is this estimate?',
    options: [
      '$43,000; 85% of the variation in costs is explained by machine hours',
      '$28,000; 85% of the variation in costs is explained by machine hours',
      '$43,000; there is an 85% probability the prediction is accurate',
      '$43,000; 15% of the variation in costs is explained by machine hours'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Predicted cost: $15,000 + ($3.50 × 8,000) = $15,000 + $28,000 = $43,000. R² = 0.85 means 85% of the variation in maintenance costs is explained by variation in machine hours. This indicates a strong relationship and reliable predictions, though R² is not a probability statement.',

    question: 'Sales for March are $200,000. Collection pattern: 30% in month of sale, 50% in month after sale, 18% two months after, 2% uncollectible. February sales were $180,000, January sales were $150,000. What are March cash collections?',

      '$6.00',
      '$6.20',
      '$6.25'

    explanation: 'Using the high-low method: Variable rate = Change in cost / Change in units = ($62,000 - $50,000) / (10,000 - 8,000) = $12,000 / 2,000 = $6.00 per unit. This represents the variable component of the mixed overhead cost.',

      'Scenario planning changes one variable at a time; sensitivity analysis changes multiple variables',

      'Sensitivity analysis is used for strategic decisions; scenario planning is for operational decisions',
      'They are the same technique with different names'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Scenario planning develops comprehensive "what-if" stories with multiple variables changing together in a coherent way (e.g., recession scenario affects sales, costs, and credit availability). Sensitivity analysis typically isolates one variable at a time to see its impact (e.g., what if sales drop 10%?).',

    explanation: 'Sales volume variance = (Actual units - Budgeted units) × Budgeted CM per unit. Budgeted CM = $50 - $30 = $20 per unit. Variance = (11,000 - 10,000) × $20 = 1,000 × $20 = $20,000 Favorable. More units sold than budgeted means favorable volume variance.',

    explanation: 'With excess capacity: Division A\'s minimum = variable cost = $60 (opportunity cost is zero). Division B\'s maximum = external purchase price = $95.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'EVA = Operating Income - (Cost of Capital × Invested Capital). EVA = $450,000 - (12% × $3,000,000) = $450,000 - $360,000 = $90,000. Positive EVA means the division is creating value above the required return on capital.',
