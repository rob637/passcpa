      'Identifying the contract with a customer',
      'Allocating the transaction price',
      'Recognizing revenue when performance obligations are satisfied',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 606 five-step model: (1) Identify the contract with a customer, (2) Identify the performance obligations, (3) Determine the transaction price, (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations, (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.

    question: 'A software company sells a license, installation services, and 2 years of updates in a single contract. Under ASC 606, how many performance obligations likely exist?',
    options: [
      'One—the entire contract is a single obligation',
      'Two—the license/installation and the updates',
      'Three—the license, installation, and updates are each distinct',
      'It depends on whether the goods and services are distinct',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606, a good or service is a separate performance obligation if it is (1) capable of being distinct (customer can benefit alone or with readily available resources), and (2) distinct within the context of the contract (not highly interrelated). The answer depends on whether installation significantly modifies the software and whether the license functions without updates.',

    explanation: 'Variable consideration is estimated using either: (1) Expected value method (probability-weighted amounts) or (2) Most likely amount method (single most likely outcome). The amount is included in the transaction price subject to the constraint: only to the extent it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur.',

      'Tests goodwill only when triggering events occur',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2017-04 simplified goodwill impairment to a one-step quantitative test: Impairment loss = Carrying amount of reporting unit - Fair value of reporting unit (limited to total goodwill for that reporting unit). The former Step 2 (implied fair value of goodwill) was eliminated. Tests are required annually and when triggering events indicate possible impairment.

Diluted shares = 100,000 + 5,000 = 105,000. Diluted EPS = $500,000 / 105,000 = $4.76. Options are dilutive because exercise price ($20) < market price ($40).',

Evidence considered: (1) future taxable income from reversing DTLs, (2) projected future taxable income, (3) tax planning strategies, (4) history of operating losses.

    question: 'A change in accounting principle (e.g., FIFO to weighted average) is generally accounted for:',
    options: [
      'Prospectively from the date of change',
      'Retrospectively, restating prior period financial statements',
      'As an extraordinary item',
      'As a current period adjustment to net income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 250, changes in accounting principles are applied retrospectively: prior period financial statements are restated as if the new method had always been used. The cumulative effect adjusts opening retained earnings of the earliest period presented. Exceptions: changes that are impracticable to apply retrospectively, and certain mandated changes with specific transition guidance.',

    question: 'Under ASC 450, a loss contingency should be accrued (recorded as a liability) when:',
    options: [
      'The loss is reasonably possible and the amount is estimable',
      'The loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated',
      'The loss is remote',
      'Any lawsuit has been filed against the company',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 450 requires accrual (debit loss, credit liability) when TWO conditions are met: (1) the loss is PROBABLE (likely to occur), and (2) the amount can be REASONABLY ESTIMATED. If probable but not estimable, or if reasonably possible (regardless of estimability), only footnote disclosure is required. If remote, no disclosure or accrual is generally needed.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 820 Fair Value Hierarchy: Level 1 = Quoted prices in ACTIVE markets for IDENTICAL assets/liabilities (most reliable). Level 2 = Observable inputs other than Level 1 (quoted prices for similar items, interest rates, yield curves). Level 3 = Unobservable inputs based on entity\'s assumptions (least reliable). Entities must maximize observable inputs and minimize unobservable inputs.',
