      'Operational plans → Tactical plans → Strategic plans',
      'Strategic plans → Tactical plans → Operational plans',
      'Tactical plans → Strategic plans → Operational plans',
      'Strategic plans → Operational plans → Tactical plans',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Strategic plans (3-5+ years, set by top management) define mission, vision, and long-term goals. Tactical plans (1-3 years, middle management) implement the strategy. Operational plans (daily/weekly/monthly, front-line managers) detail specific actions and budgets. Each level adds specificity and shorter time horizons.',

    explanation: 'Required Production = Budgeted Sales + Desired Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory = 50,000 + 10,000 - 8,000 = 52,000 units. The formula ensures enough units are produced to meet sales demand AND build desired inventory levels. If ending inventory decreases, production can be less than sales.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ABB budgets costs by first estimating the demand for activities (driven by output expectations), then determining the resources needed for those activities. It provides better cost visibility than traditional line-item budgeting, links costs to value-creating activities, and makes budgets more meaningful for cost management.

      'Only revenue growth targets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Kaizen budgeting builds in expected continuous improvement through small, incremental cost reductions each period. Budgeted costs systematically decrease period over period (e.g., reducing material waste by 1% per quarter). It aligns with the Japanese Kaizen philosophy of ongoing improvement and is used with lean manufacturing environments.',

    options: [
      'Paying more for materials than standard',
      'Using more total material than standard',
      'Changing the proportion of different materials used from the standard mix',
      'The difference between actual and standard output',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Material mix variance = Σ[(Actual qty at actual mix - Actual qty at standard mix) × Standard price]. It isolates the cost effect of deviating from the standard mix of inputs. Material yield variance measures the impact of total input quantity on output. Together, mix + yield = total material quantity variance. These are important in process industries (chemicals, food processing) with multiple inputs.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The master budget consists of: (1) Operating budgets (sales, production, DM, DL, OH, S&A, budgeted income statement) and (2) Financial budgets (capital expenditure budget, cash budget, budgeted balance sheet). The capital budget plans long-term asset acquisitions and is typically approved separately by senior management or the board due to the magnitude and long-term impact of these investments.',

      'It fails to incorporate front-line knowledge',

      'It takes less time than top-down budgeting',
      'It reduces employee motivation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Budgetary slack occurs when managers intentionally understate revenues or overstate costs to make targets easier to achieve. This is the primary disadvantage of participative budgeting. Other disadvantages: time-consuming, may lack strategic alignment. Advantages: better information from front-line managers, greater buy-in and motivation, more realistic targets. Mitigated by stretch targets and variance analysis.',
