    question: 'Alpha Division has NOPAT of $800,000 and invested capital of $5,000,000. The weighted-average cost of capital is 12%. What is EVA?',
    options: [
      '$600,000',
      '-$200,000',
      '$200,000',
      '$800,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'EVA = NOPAT - (Capital × WACC) = $800,000 - ($5,000,000 × 12%) = $800,000 - $600,000 = $200,000. Positive EVA indicates the division is creating value above its cost of capital.',

      'Deducted from invested capital',
      'Capitalized and amortized to reflect economic reality',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'EVA makes adjustments to GAAP accounting. R&D is capitalized and amortized because it provides future economic benefits. This prevents managers from cutting R&D to boost short-term profits.',

      '$20',
      '$50',
      '$40',

      'The selling division records at cost plus markup, buying division records at a lower amount',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
