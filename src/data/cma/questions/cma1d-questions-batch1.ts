      'They remain constant in total as activity changes',
      'They remain constant per unit as activity changes',
      'They decrease per unit as activity decreases',
      'They increase per unit as activity increases',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Variable costs remain constant per unit but change in total proportionally with activity. If you produce more units, total variable costs increase, but the cost per unit stays the same.',
