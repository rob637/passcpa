    question: 'Which design principle is MOST important when building an executive dashboard for management reporting?',
    options: [
      'Including every available metric to provide comprehensive coverage',
      'Presenting only key performance indicators with clear visual hierarchies and exception-based alerts',
      'Using identical formats across all organizational levels',
      'Requiring manual data entry to ensure management reviews each metric',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Effective executive dashboards prioritize key performance indicators with clear visual hierarchies, drill-down capability, and exception-based alerts.
