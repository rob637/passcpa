    question: 'Current assets: $500,000 (including inventory $200,000, prepaid expenses $30,000). Current liabilities: $250,000. What is the quick (acid-test) ratio?',

      '1.08',
      '2.00',
      '1.20',
      '0.80',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Quick ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory - Prepaid Expenses) / Current Liabilities = ($500,000 - $200,000 - $30,000) / $250,000 = $270,000 / $250,000 = 1.08. This measures ability to meet short-term obligations without relying on inventory sale.',

      'Cannot determine without more information',
      'Both have equal ROE of 24%',
      'Company A with ROE of 24%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'ROE = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier. Company A: 8% × 1.5 × 2.0 = 24%. Company B: 5% × 2.0 × 3.0 = 30%. Company B has higher ROE but uses more leverage (equity multiplier 3.0 vs 2.0).',

    question: 'Operating cash flow: $180,000. Current liabilities: $150,000. What is the operating cash flow ratio, and how should it be interpreted?',
    options: [
      '1.20; operating cash flow is inadequate for debt service',

      '0.83; the company has excess liquidity',
      '0.83; the company cannot cover current liabilities from operations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow / Current Liabilities = $180,000 / $150,000 = 1.20. A ratio above 1.0 indicates the company generates enough operating cash to cover current liabilities, a positive liquidity indicator.',

      'Potentially lower quality—large gap suggests accruals may need investigation',
      'High quality—accrual accounting provides better matching',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'When net income significantly exceeds operating cash flow, the difference represents accruals that may warrant scrutiny. Large positive accruals can indicate aggressive revenue recognition, understated expenses, or other issues affecting earnings quality.',

      'Decrease firm value due to higher risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'With taxes, the MM theory shows that leverage creates value through the interest tax shield—interest is tax deductible, reducing the firm\'s tax burden. This increases firm value, though the effect is limited by costs of financial distress at high leverage levels.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'With excess capacity, only variable costs are relevant—fixed costs continue regardless. Contribution = $70 - $60 = $10 per unit. Total contribution = 1,000 × $10 = $10,000. Accept the order as it increases overall profit.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'DOL = Contribution Margin / Operating Income = $200,000 / $50,000 = 4.0. This means a 1% increase in sales will increase operating income by 4%. High DOL indicates high fixed costs relative to variable costs.',
