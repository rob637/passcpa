      'Profit Margin × Asset Turnover',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Three-component DuPont: ROE = (Net Income/Sales) × (Sales/Assets) × (Assets/Equity) = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier. This decomposes ROE into profitability, efficiency, and leverage.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A: 3% × 2.5 × 2.0 = 15%. B: 10% × 1.0 × 1.5 = 15%. Company A uses higher leverage (2.0 vs 1.5) and lower margin to achieve the same ROE, indicating higher financial risk.',
