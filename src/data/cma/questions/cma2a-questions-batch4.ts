    question: 'A company has current assets of $450,000 (including $80,000 inventory and $20,000 prepaid expenses) and current liabilities of $200,000. The quick ratio is:',
    options: [
      '1.75',
      '2.15',
      '1.85',
      '2.25',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) / Current liabilities = ($450,000 - $80,000 - $20,000) / $200,000 = $350,000 / $200,000 = 1.75. The quick ratio excludes less liquid current assets like inventory and prepaid expenses to measure ability to meet short-term obligations with the most liquid assets.',

      '40 days',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Cash Conversion Cycle = DIO + DSO - DPO = 45 + 35 - 40 = 40 days. The CCC measures the time between paying for inventory and collecting cash from customers. A shorter CCC indicates better working capital efficiency—the company is converting inventory to cash more quickly relative to its payment timeline.',

    question: 'A company reports net income of $180,000, interest expense of $30,000, and a tax rate of 25%. Total assets are $2,000,000. The return on assets (ROA) using the full formula is:',

    explanation: 'ROA (with interest add-back) = [Net Income + Interest Expense × (1 - Tax Rate)] / Total Assets = [$180,000 + $30,000 × (1 - 0.25)] / $2,000,000 = [$180,000 + $22,500] / $2,000,000 = $202,500 / $2,000,000 = 10.125% ≈ 10.1%.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'ROE = Net Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier. If margin and turnover are constant, only the equity multiplier can explain the ROE change. A decrease in the equity multiplier (Assets/Equity) means less leverage—the firm reduced debt financing. Less leverage reduces ROE when positive leverage exists (ROA exceeds after-tax cost of debt).',

    explanation: 'Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio = (EBIT + Lease Payments) / (Interest Expense + Lease Payments) = ($400,000 + $60,000) / ($100,000 + $60,000) = $460,000 / $160,000 = 2.875 ≈ 2.88x.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Debt-to-equity ratio = Total Debt / Total Stockholders\' Equity. It measures the proportion of debt financing relative to equity financing.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Accounts Receivable Turnover = Net Credit Sales / Average A/R = $3,600,000 / $400,000 = 9.0x. Average Collection Period = 365 / A/R Turnover = 365 / 9.0 = 40.6 days.

      'Company A carries excessive inventory',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A turnover of 12x vs. industry average of 8x means Company A sells and replaces inventory much faster. While higher turnover generally indicates efficiency, an unusually high ratio may indicate insufficient inventory leading to stockouts, lost sales, and dissatisfied customers.

      'The company is collecting cash faster than recognizing revenue',
      'High-quality earnings supported by cash flows',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When net income significantly exceeds operating cash flow, the difference is the accrual component. A high accrual ratio (NI - OCF) / Total Assets signals potential earnings quality issues—the company may be using aggressive revenue recognition, delaying expense recognition, or building up receivables/inventory.

      'Receivables growing in line with revenue',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'When receivables grow much faster than revenue, it may indicate channel stuffing, bill-and-hold transactions, premature revenue recognition, or extended credit terms to boost reported sales.

      'Higher expected future earnings growth relative to peers',
      'The market pricing in lower growth expectations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'A higher P/E ratio indicates investors are willing to pay more per dollar of current earnings, typically because they expect higher future earnings growth. From the Gordon Growth Model: P/E = Payout Ratio / (r - g). Higher growth (g) increases P/E. However, a high P/E could also indicate overvaluation, so growth expectations must be validated.',

    explanation: 'The Altman Z-Score uses multiple discriminant analysis combining five ratios: Z = 1.2(Working Capital/TA) + 1.4(Retained Earnings/TA) + 3.3(EBIT/TA) + 0.6(Market Equity/Book Debt) + 1.0(Sales/TA). Z > 2.99 = safe zone; 1.81-2.99 = grey zone; < 1.81 = distress zone. It captures liquidity, profitability, leverage, solvency, and efficiency.',

    question: 'A company has ROE of 15% and a dividend payout ratio of 40%. The sustainable growth rate is:',
    options: [
      '15.0%',
      '10.0%',
      '9.0%',
      '6.0%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Sustainable Growth Rate = ROE × Retention Ratio = ROE × (1 - Dividend Payout Ratio) = 15% × (1 - 0.40) = 15% × 0.60 = 9.0%. The SGR represents the maximum rate at which a firm can grow sales without changing its capital structure or issuing new equity. Growing faster than SGR requires additional external financing or improved efficiency.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Cross-sectional (peer) analysis compares a firm\'s ratios to industry peers. Key limitations include: different accounting policies (LIFO vs FIFO, depreciation methods), diversified firms that span multiple industries, size differences affecting economies of scale, different fiscal year-ends, and different business models within the same industry. Analysts must carefully select comparable firms.',
