      'Diversifiable risk',
      'Operational risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Systematic (market) risk affects all securities and cannot be eliminated through diversification. Examples include interest rates, inflation, and recession. Unsystematic risk is company-specific and can be diversified away.',

      'Move in the opposite direction of the market',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Beta measures systematic risk. A beta of 1.5 means the stock moves 1.5 times as much as the market - if the market rises 10%, the stock is expected to rise 15%. Beta > 1 = more volatile than market.',

    explanation: 'CAPM: Required return = Rf + β(Rm - Rf) = 3% + 1.25(11% - 3%) = 3% + 1.25(8%) = 3% + 10% = 13%.',

    explanation: 'WACC = (Weight of debt × Cost of debt) + (Weight of equity × Cost of equity) = (0.40 × 5%) + (0.60 × 12%) = 2% + 7.2% = 9.2%.',
