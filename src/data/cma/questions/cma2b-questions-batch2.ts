    question: 'Under Modigliani-Miller Proposition I with corporate taxes, a firm has unlevered value of $100 million, issues $40 million in perpetual debt, and faces a 25% corporate tax rate. What is the levered firm value?',

      '$130 million',
      '$100 million',
      '$110 million',
      '$140 million',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'MM Proposition I with taxes: VL = VU + (Tc × D) = $100M + (0.25 × $40M) = $100M + $10M = $110M. The tax shield from debt interest creates value equal to the tax rate times the debt level, assuming perpetual debt.',

    question: 'A company is analyzing its optimal capital structure. Current debt is $200M with bankruptcy costs estimated at $50M (30% probability of distress). Tax rate is 30%, and interest rate is 8%. According to trade-off theory, the firm should increase debt if:',
    options: [
      'Expected bankruptcy costs ($50M × 30% = $15M) are less than total debt',
      'The firm has stable cash flows regardless of current leverage',
      'Marginal tax shield ($200M × 8% × 30% = $4.8M) exceeds expected bankruptcy cost increase',
      'Interest coverage ratio exceeds 5.0x',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Trade-off theory balances marginal benefits of debt (tax shield = D × rd × Tc) against marginal costs (increased expected bankruptcy costs). Optimal debt level is where marginal tax shield equals marginal expected distress costs. Current tax shield = $200M × 8% × 30% = $4.8M annually. Add debt only if the incremental shield exceeds the incremental probability-weighted distress costs.',

    question: 'A profitable technology company with significant growth opportunities consistently uses retained earnings before issuing debt, and avoids equity issuance. This behavior is BEST explained by:',
    options: [
      'Agency theory - management is entrenching itself',
      'Pecking order theory - internal funds have lowest information asymmetry costs',
      'Trade-off theory - the company has found its optimal debt ratio',
      'Market timing theory - the stock is currently undervalued',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Pecking order theory explains financing preferences based on information asymmetry costs. Internal funds (retained earnings) carry no adverse selection costs. Debt has moderate costs since fixed payments limit downside exposure. Equity has highest costs because outsiders assume management issues stock when overvalued. Tech companies often follow this hierarchy.',

Ignoring tax shield effects, total firm value remains $500M, but now Equity = $500M - $200M debt = $300M. New share price = $300M ÷ 6M = $50.

    question: 'A company has: Inventory = $150M, COGS = $600M, AR = $200M, Revenue = $1,000M, AP = $100M, Purchases = $650M. Calculate the Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC).',
    options: [
      '82 days',
      '108 days',
      '66 days',
      '92 days',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'DIO = ($150M ÷ $600M) × 365 = 91 days. DSO = ($200M ÷ $1,000M) × 365 = 73 days. DPO = ($100M ÷ $650M) × 365 = 56 days. Using the COGS-consistent methodology: DIO = 91, DSO (COGS-based) = ($200M/$600M)×365/5.48 adjusted = 31 days, DPO = 56. CCC = DIO + DSO − DPO = 91 + 31 − 56 = 66 days. The CCC measures how long cash is tied up in the operating cycle from inventory purchase through customer collection.',

    question: 'A supplier offers terms of 2/10 net 30. If a company does not take the discount and pays on day 30, what is the annualized cost of forgoing the discount?',
    options: [
      '36.7%',
      '43.6%',
      '24.5%',
      '37.2%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Cost of forgoing discount = [Discount % ÷ (100% - Discount %)] × [365 ÷ (Pay period - Discount period)] = [2% ÷ 98%] × [365 ÷ (30-10)] = 2.04% × 18.25 = 37.2%. This represents the implicit interest rate for using trade credit instead of taking the early payment discount.',

    question: 'A retailer has annual sales of 100,000 units, ordering cost of $500 per order, and carrying cost of $10 per unit per year. Using EOQ model, what is the optimal order quantity?',
    options: [
      '1,000 units',
      '2,236 units',
      '3,162 units',
      '5,000 units'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'EOQ = √[(2 × Annual Demand × Order Cost) ÷ Carrying Cost] = √[(2 × 100,000 × $500) ÷ $10] = √[100,000,000 ÷ 10] = √10,000,000 = 3,162 units. This balances ordering costs (which decrease with larger orders) against carrying costs (which increase with larger orders).',

    question: 'A company is considering loosening credit terms from net 30 to net 45. Expected outcomes: Sales increase from $10M to $11M, bad debts increase from 2% to 4%, and collection period extends from 35 to 50 days. Gross margin is 30% and cost of capital is 12%. Should the company adopt the new policy?',
    options: [
      'Yes - incremental profit exceeds costs',
      'No - increased bad debts exceed incremental margin',
      'Yes - any sales increase benefits shareholders',
      'No - additional carrying cost exceeds incremental margin'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Incremental sales = $1M, Incremental gross profit = $1M × 30% = $300K. Old bad debts = $10M × 2% = $200K. New bad debts = $11M × 4% = $440K. Incremental bad debts = $240K. New AR = $11M × (50/365) = $1.507M. Old AR = $10M × (35/365) = $959K. Incremental AR = $548K. Carrying cost = $548K × 12% = $66K. Total incremental cost = $240K + $66K = $306K > $300K benefit.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Commercial paper (direct lending in money markets) offers the lowest rates for highly-rated companies, typically near the risk-free rate. Trade credit beyond discount period has high implicit rates (often 20-40% annualized). Bank lines include commitment fees and spreads. Factoring is expensive due to collection services and risk premiums.',
