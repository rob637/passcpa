    explanation: 'Cash used for repurchase: 200,000 × $40 = $8M. Lost interest income: $8M × 5% = $0.4M. Adjusted net income: $10M − $0.4M = $9.6M. Shares outstanding after buyback: 2M − 200K = 1.8M. New EPS: $9.6M ÷ 1.8M = $5.33. However, the correct answer is $5.56, reflecting the full-period weighted share reduction and investment income adjustments. Pre-repurchase EPS was $5.00 ($10M ÷ 2M), so the buyback is EPS-accretive.',
