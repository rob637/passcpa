    question: 'A company has 60% equity and 40% debt in its capital structure. The cost of equity is 14%, the before-tax cost of debt is 8%, and the tax rate is 25%. What is the WACC?',
    options: [
      '10.0%',
      '10.8%',
      '11.6%',
      '10.4%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'WACC = (Weight of Equity × Cost of Equity) + (Weight of Debt × After-tax Cost of Debt) = (0.60 × 14%) + (0.40 × 8% × (1 - 0.25)) = 8.4% + 2.4% = 10.8%. The after-tax cost of debt is lower than the before-tax rate because interest expense is tax-deductible, creating a tax shield of 8% × 25% = 2%.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'CAPM: r = Rf + β × (Rm - Rf) = 3% + 1.3 × (10% - 3%) = 3% + 1.3 × 7% = 3% + 9.1% = 12.1%. The CAPM estimates the cost of equity based on the risk-free rate plus a risk premium scaled by the stock\'s systematic risk (beta). A beta of 1.3 means 30% more volatile than the market.',

Note that D₁ (next year\'s dividend) = D₀ × (1 + g) = $2.50 × 1.05 = $2.625. This model provides an alternative to CAPM for estimating the cost of equity for dividend-paying companies.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'MM Proposition II (with taxes): Cost of Equity = Ru + (Ru - Rd) × (D/E) × (1 - T), where Ru = unlevered cost of equity. As D/E increases, cost of equity rises linearly because equity holders demand higher returns for bearing increased financial risk. However, WACC initially decreases due to the tax shield of debt (up to the optimal capital structure).',

      'The firm uses 100% equity financing',
      'The cost of equity equals the cost of debt',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The trade-off theory balances the tax benefits of debt against the costs of financial distress (bankruptcy costs, agency costs, loss of customers/suppliers). The optimal capital structure maximizes firm value where the marginal tax shield benefit of an additional dollar of debt equals the marginal expected cost of financial distress from that debt.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The pecking order theory (Myers & Majluf, 1984) states firms prefer internal financing first (retained earnings), then debt, and finally equity as a last resort. This results from information asymmetry—managers know more than investors, so issuing equity signals overvaluation. Retained earnings have no adverse selection costs; debt has moderate costs; equity has the highest.',

    difficulty: 'hard',

    question: 'Under a residual dividend policy, a company with $10M in earnings and $7M in equity-funded capital expenditures (at a 60% equity target) would pay dividends of:',

      '$3.0M',
      '$5.8M',
      '$4.2M',
      '$0',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Residual dividend = Earnings - Equity portion of capital budget. Equity needed = $7M × 0.60 = $4.2M. Residual dividend = $10M - $4.2M = $5.8M. The residual policy pays dividends only from earnings left after funding all positive-NPV projects with the target capital structure.

      'Being required by SEC regulations annually',
      'Always increasing the stock price immediately',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Stock repurchases offer tax advantages: shareholders who do not sell pay no taxes, and those who sell are taxed at capital gains rates (potentially lower than dividend tax rates). Additional benefits: flexibility (no signaling of a cut if repurchases stop), increases EPS for remaining shares, and can be used to offset dilution from stock options.',

      '707 units',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'EOQ = √(2 × D × S / H) = √(2 × 10,000 × $50 / $2) = √(1,000,000 / 2) = √500,000 = 707 units. At this order quantity, total ordering costs equal total carrying costs, minimizing total inventory costs. Number of orders per year = 10,000/707 ≈ 14.1 orders.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Offering a 2% discount for payment within 10 days (2/10) incentivizes faster payment, reducing the average collection period and investment in accounts receivable. The cost to the company is the 2% discount on early payments. The annualized cost of the discount = (2%/98%) × (365/20) ≈ 37.2%, making it expensive financing but effective for cash flow acceleration.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IPO underpricing occurs when the first-day market price exceeds the offer price. This is a cost to the issuing company (money left on the table). Average first-day returns for IPOs are typically 10-20%. Explanations include: winner\'s curse, information asymmetry, underwriter reputation concerns, and lawsuit avoidance.

      'Bondholders must sell when commanded',
      'It eliminates all interest rate risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A call provision allows the issuer to retire the bond before maturity, typically at a premium (call price > par). If interest rates decline, the issuer can call existing high-coupon bonds and refinance at lower rates. The cost is that callable bonds must offer higher coupons than non-callable bonds to compensate investors for call risk.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A horizontal merger combines two companies in the same industry at the same stage of production (e.g., two automakers).

    explanation: 'The acquisition premium = Offer Price - Target\'s pre-announcement market price. It represents the additional value the acquirer pays beyond the target\'s standalone value. The premium must be justified by expected synergies (cost savings, revenue enhancement). Average premiums range from 20-40% above pre-announcement market price.

    explanation: 'Transaction exposure affects existing obligations (accounts receivable, accounts payable, loans) denominated in a foreign currency.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Since the company will receive euros, it faces the risk that euros will depreciate against the dollar. To hedge, sell euros forward (agree to deliver €1M in 90 days at a predetermined rate). Alternatively, use a money market hedge: borrow euros now, convert to USD, invest in USD, repay euro loan when received. Buying a put option on euros also hedges the downside.',

      'Spot rates always equal forward rates',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRP states: Forward Rate / Spot Rate = (1 + rd) / (1 + rf), where rd = domestic interest rate and rf = foreign interest rate. If domestic rates exceed foreign rates, the foreign currency trades at a forward premium (and vice versa). This prevents covered interest arbitrage.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Commercial paper is unsecured, short-term debt (typically 1-270 days) issued by large, creditworthy corporations at a discount from face value. It typically offers lower rates than bank loans because it avoids intermediation costs. Only firms with high credit ratings can access the commercial paper market. Maximum maturity is 270 days to avoid SEC registration.',

    question: 'If a company\'s cost of retained earnings (using CAPM) is 14%, and flotation costs for new equity are 6%, the cost of newly issued common stock is approximately:',
    options: [
      '14.0%',
      '14.89%',
      '20.0%',
      '8.0%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Cost of new equity = Cost of retained earnings / (1 - Flotation cost %) = 14% / (1 - 0.06) = 14% / 0.94 = 14.89%. Flotation costs (underwriting fees, legal costs, etc.) increase the effective cost of new equity above retained earnings. This creates a breakpoint in the MCC schedule when retained earnings are exhausted.',
