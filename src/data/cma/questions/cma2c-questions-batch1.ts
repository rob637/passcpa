      'Yes, because incremental profit is $20,000',
      'Yes, because revenue increases by $50,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Incremental revenue = 1,000 × $50 = $50,000. Incremental variable costs = 1,000 × $30 = $30,000. Incremental contribution margin = $20,000. The campaign cost of $20,000 equals the incremental CM, making it breakeven on a purely financial basis. However, the $20,000 incremental contribution margin covers the campaign cost while also generating brand awareness and customer acquisition value, making it a worthwhile investment.',

    question: 'A company with excess capacity gets a special order for 1,000 units at $25 each. Variable cost is $20 and full cost is $28. Should they accept?',
    options: [
      'No, because the offer is below full cost',

      'Yes, because they will earn $25,000 revenue',
      'No, because they will lose $3 per unit',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'With excess capacity, fixed costs are irrelevant (they\'re incurred anyway). Accept if price ≥ variable cost. $25 > $20, so contribution = $5 × 1,000 = $5,000 additional profit.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
