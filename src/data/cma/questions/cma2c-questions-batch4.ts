    question: 'A company sells Product X (CM $20, 60% of sales mix) and Product Y (CM $30, 40% of sales mix). Fixed costs are $480,000. The breakeven point in total units is:',
    options: [
      '12,000 units',
      '16,000 units',
      '20,000 units',
      '24,000 units',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Weighted average CM = ($20 × 0.60) + ($30 × 0.40) = $12 + $12 = $24. Breakeven units = Fixed Costs / Weighted Average CM = $480,000 / $24 = 20,000 total units. Product X = 20,000 × 60% = 12,000 units. Product Y = 20,000 × 40% = 8,000 units. The sales mix is critical—if mix shifts toward higher CM products, breakeven decreases.',

      'Higher degree of operating leverage and greater profit sensitivity to volume changes',
      'Lower contribution margin per unit',
      'More stable profits regardless of volume',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'High fixed costs create high operating leverage (DOL = CM/Operating Income). This means profits are more sensitive to changes in sales volume—amplifying both profits (above breakeven) and losses (below breakeven). The breakeven point is higher with more fixed costs. The relationship is: DOL is highest near breakeven and approaches 1.0 as volume increases significantly.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Margin of Safety = (Actual Sales - Breakeven Sales) / Actual Sales = ($1,200,000 - $900,000) / $1,200,000 = $300,000 / $1,200,000 = 25%. This means sales can drop by 25% before the company reaches breakeven. A higher margin of safety indicates lower risk. The relationship to DOL: Margin of Safety % = 1 / DOL.',

      'Historical costs of inventory already on hand',

    explanation: 'Relevant costs are future costs that differ between alternatives. Opportunity costs represent the benefit foregone from the next best alternative and are always relevant. Allocated overhead (if unchanged), depreciation on existing equipment, and historical inventory costs are sunk or unavoidable—they are irrelevant to the decision because they do not change.',

    explanation: 'An avoidable (escapable) cost is eliminated when a segment, product, or activity is discontinued. These are relevant to keep-or-drop decisions. A segment should be dropped only if its avoidable costs exceed its revenue (contribution to unavoidable costs). Unavoidable costs continue regardless and would be reallocated to remaining segments.',

    question: 'A company currently makes a component for $18/unit (DM $6, DL $4, Variable OH $3, Fixed OH $5). An outside supplier offers it for $15/unit. If $2 of fixed OH is avoidable and idle capacity has no alternative use, the company should:',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Relevant cost to make = DM + DL + Variable OH + Avoidable Fixed OH = $6 + $4 + $3 + $2 = $15. Cost to buy = $15. The relevant costs are equal ($15 each).

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The $50,000 contribution from alternative use of capacity is an opportunity cost of the make alternative. By choosing to make, the company forgoes $50,000 from the alternative product. This must be added to the relevant costs of making to properly compare alternatives.

    difficulty: 'hard',

    question: 'A company operates at 70% capacity. Normal selling price is $50/unit (variable cost $30, fixed cost $12/unit at current volume). A special order for 5,000 units at $35/unit is received. The order should be:',
    options: [
      'Accepted only if fixed costs can be reduced',

      'Accepted because it will contribute $25,000 to profit ($5/unit × 5,000)',
      'Rejected because it is below the normal selling price',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'With excess capacity, fixed costs are irrelevant (they are incurred regardless). The relevant comparison: Special order price ($35) vs. Variable cost ($30). Contribution margin = $5/unit × 5,000 = $25,000 incremental profit. Accept the order.

      'Variable cost plus opportunity cost of displaced regular sales',
      'Variable cost per unit',
      'Total cost per unit',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'At full capacity, accepting a special order requires displacing regular production. Minimum price = Variable cost + Lost contribution margin per unit on regular sales. At excess capacity, minimum price = Variable cost only (no displacement). This is a critical distinction on the CMA exam—always check capacity status first.',

    question: 'Division Z reports revenue of $400,000, variable costs of $250,000, direct fixed costs of $100,000, and allocated common costs of $80,000. Should Division Z be dropped?',
    options: [

      'Yes, it shows a loss of $30,000',
      'Yes, its segment margin is negative',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Segment margin = Revenue - Variable costs - Direct fixed costs = $400,000 - $250,000 - $100,000 = $50,000 positive. If dropped, the company loses this $50,000 segment margin while the $80,000 allocated common costs continue (reallocated to other divisions). Dropping Division Z reduces total profit by $50,000.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Market-based transfer pricing works best when a competitive external market exists for the intermediate product, providing an objective, arm\'s-length price.

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Dual transfer pricing uses two different prices: the selling division records revenue at market price (maintaining profit incentive), while the buying division records cost at variable cost or full cost (encouraging internal sourcing). This eliminates goal incongruence but creates artificial profits (sum of division profits exceeds company profit) and requires reconciliation at consolidation.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'With elastic demand (|Ed| > 1), quantity demanded is highly responsive to price changes. A price decrease leads to a proportionally larger increase in quantity, so total revenue rises. Conversely, a price increase with elastic demand decreases revenue.

      'Focusing exclusively on variable costs',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Life cycle costing captures ALL costs across a product\'s entire life: R&D, design, manufacturing, marketing/distribution, customer service, and disposal/recycling. This holistic view reveals that 80-85% of a product\'s lifetime cost is committed during the design phase, making early cost management critical. Traditional costing focuses mainly on production-period costs.',

    options: [
      'Pricing based on cost plus a standard markup',
      'Setting a high initial price and lowering it over time',
      'Setting a low initial price to gain market share quickly',
      'Matching competitor prices exactly',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Penetration pricing sets a low initial price to attract customers, build market share, and deter competitors. Best when demand is price-elastic, economies of scale exist, and there is limited product differentiation. Price skimming is the opposite—high initial price for early adopters, then gradually lowering. Best for innovative products with inelastic demand initially.',

    question: 'A firm receives a special order but must use material originally purchased for $5/unit (current replacement cost $7/unit, salvage value $2/unit, no other use). The relevant cost of the material for the special order is:',
    options: [
      '$5 (original cost)',
      '$7 (replacement cost)',
      '$0 (it is a sunk cost)',
      '$2 (net realizable value/salvage)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'For material already on hand with no alternative use: the relevant cost is the net realizable value (salvage value of $2). The original cost ($5) is sunk. Replacement cost ($7) is relevant only if the material will be replaced for other use. Since there is no other use, the opportunity cost is what could be recovered by selling it ($2). Using it foregoes $2 in salvage proceeds.',
