    question: 'A portfolio has value of $10 million, expected daily return of 0.05%, and daily standard deviation of 1.5%. Calculate the 1-day VaR at 95% confidence (z = 1.65).',
    options: [

      '$247,500',
      '$242,500',
      '$150,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Parametric VaR = Portfolio Value × (Expected Return - z × Standard Deviation) = $10M × (0.0005 - 1.65 × 0.015) = $10M × (0.0005 - 0.02475) = $10M × (-0.02425) = -$242,500. The negative sign indicates potential loss. VaR = $242,500, meaning there is 5% probability of losing more than $242,500 in one day.',

      '$3.16 million',
      '$500,000',
      '$7.9 million',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'VaR scales with the square root of time: VaR(T) = VaR(1) × √T. Annual VaR = $500,000 × √250 = $500,000 × 15.81 = $7,905,000 ≈ $7.9 million. This assumes returns are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), which may not hold during market stress.',

      'VaR cannot be calculated for portfolios with derivatives',
      'VaR does not indicate the magnitude of loss beyond the confidence level',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'VaR indicates the maximum loss within a confidence level but says nothing about tail risk - losses exceeding VaR. A 95% VaR of $1M means 5% of the time losses exceed $1M, but could be $1.1M or $50M. Expected Shortfall (CVaR) addresses this by measuring average loss in the tail.',

      '$2.3 million divided by 500',
      '$2.3 million',
      'Cannot determine from this information',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: '95% confidence means we want the 5th percentile of losses. With 10,000 simulations, 5% = 500 observations. The 500th worst outcome (boundary of worst 5%) is the VaR. At 95% VaR, there is 5% probability of losses exceeding $2.3 million. This historical simulation approach uses actual simulated distribution.',

      '$3.5 million',
      '$1.75 million',
      '$1 million',
      '$2.5 million',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Expected Shortfall (Conditional VaR) is the expected loss given that loss exceeds VaR - the average of tail losses. If losses exceeding the $1M VaR average $2.5M, then CVaR = $2.5M. CVaR is a coherent risk measure (unlike VaR) and better captures tail risk.',

If stock drops below $45, puts are exercised, receiving $45,000. Max loss = $52,000 - $45,000 = $7,000. Breakeven = Stock must rise to cover premium = $50 + $2 = $52.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'A zero-cost collar uses put premium received from selling calls to fund put purchase. Long put at $45 protects if stock falls below $45. Short call at $55 caps gains above $55 (shares called away). The position is protected between $45 (floor) and $55 (ceiling) at no net premium cost.

      '$10.8 million',
      '$11.0 million',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Put option guarantees ability to sell euros at $1.08. If euro falls below $1.08, exercise put. Minimum receipt = €10M × $1.08 = $10.8M, minus premium = €10M × $0.02 = $0.2M. Net minimum = $10.8M - $0.2M = $10.6M. If euro rises above $1.08, let put expire and convert at higher spot rate minus premium paid.',

      'The option price moves $0.60 for each $1 move in the underlying',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Delta measures option price sensitivity to underlying price changes. Delta of 0.6 means a $1 increase in stock price increases option value by $0.60.

Adding amortized premium (say $500K over the period), effective rate ≈ 5.5%. The cap limits interest cost to strike plus premium cost.',

      'Insurance coverage for 5% of assets',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Earnings volatility is measured by standard deviation relative to the mean (coefficient of variation).

    explanation: 'Economic capital is the internally-calculated capital buffer to absorb unexpected losses at a chosen confidence level. At 99.9%, there is 0.1% annual probability that losses exceed $500M, leading to insolvency.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Stress testing reveals capital needs under adverse scenarios. A $150M swing (from +$100M to -$50M) indicates the company needs at least $50M in reserves to absorb losses during the modeled recession.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The distribution is highly skewed with fat tails - rare events (1%) cause disproportionate losses.

    question: 'An airline needs 10 million gallons of jet fuel in 6 months. Current price is $2.50/gallon. They hedge with futures at $2.60/gallon. If spot price at delivery is $3.00, what is their effective price per gallon?',
    options: [
      '$2.60 - locked in futures price',
      '$2.80 - average of futures and spot',
      '$3.00 - paid spot price',
      '$2.50 - original spot price',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Futures hedge locks in the purchase price. At delivery: Buy fuel at spot $3.00, but futures profit = $3.00 - $2.60 = $0.40/gallon. Net cost = $3.00 - $0.40 = $2.60/gallon. Regardless of spot price movement, the effective cost equals the futures contract price of $2.60. Total cost = 10M × $2.60 = $26M.',
