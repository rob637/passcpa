    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'NPV = -$500,000 + $150,000 × PVIFA(12%, 5). PVIFA(12%, 5) = 3.6048. NPV = -$500,000 + $150,000 × 3.6048 = -$500,000 + $540,720 = $40,720 ≈ $40,800. The project adds value and should be accepted.',

    question: 'A project has an initial cost of $100,000, generates $40,000 per year for 4 years, and has a WACC of 10%. What is the MIRR approach to resolving multiple IRR problems?',
    options: [

      'Use the highest of the multiple IRRs',
      'Average the multiple IRRs together',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'MIRR resolves the multiple IRR problem by assuming that positive cash flows are reinvested at the cost of capital (WACC) and negative cash flows are financed at the financing rate. This produces a single, unique rate of return that is more realistic than the traditional IRR assumption of reinvestment at the IRR itself.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'NPV vs IRR ranking conflicts for mutually exclusive projects arise from: (1) scale differences (different initial investments), and (2) timing differences (when cash flows occur). The reinvestment rate assumption also differs—IRR assumes reinvestment at the IRR; NPV assumes reinvestment at WACC. NPV is the preferred criterion because it measures absolute value creation.',

      'Cannot be used for projects with uneven cash flows',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The simple payback method ignores all cash flows after the payback period, which means it fails to consider the total profitability of a project. It also ignores the time value of money (though the discounted payback addresses this). A project could have a short payback but negative overall NPV if large costs follow.',

      'The project\'s IRR',
      'The risk-free rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Lease payments are contractual obligations similar to debt payments. The appropriate discount rate for lease cash flows is the after-tax cost of borrowing (after-tax cost of debt), which reflects the risk level of these fixed, contractual payments. Using WACC would be inappropriate because it includes the cost of equity, which is for riskier operating cash flows.',

      'Off-balance-sheet treatment under old standards and flexibility to upgrade',
      'Ability to claim depreciation deductions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Operating leases historically kept assets off the balance sheet (though ASC 842 now requires right-of-use asset recognition). They still provide flexibility to upgrade equipment, avoid obsolescence risk, and typically include maintenance. The lessee cannot depreciate the asset (the lessor does), and total cost often exceeds purchase price.',

      'Cost of new machine minus after-tax salvage of old machine',
      'Cost of new machine only',
      'Book value of old machine',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The relevant initial outlay for a replacement decision = Cost of new equipment - After-tax proceeds from sale of old equipment ± Tax on gain/loss from old equipment ± Change in net working capital. The original cost and book value of the old machine are sunk costs; only the current salvage value (net of tax effects) is relevant.',

    question: 'An old machine has a book value of $40,000 and can be sold for $25,000. A new machine costs $120,000. The tax rate is 30%. What is the net initial outlay for the replacement?',

      '$95,000',
      '$99,500',
      '$80,000',
      '$90,500',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Sale of old machine for $25,000 creates a loss of $40,000 - $25,000 = $15,000. Tax savings from the loss = $15,000 × 30% = $4,500. After-tax proceeds from old machine = $25,000 + $4,500 = $29,500. Net initial outlay = Cost of new machine - After-tax proceeds from old = $120,000 - $29,500 = $90,500.

      'Reduces cash flow estimates for uncertain projects',
      'Eliminates the need for probability analysis',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The risk-adjusted discount rate (RADR) method adds a risk premium to the base required rate of return for projects with above-average risk. Higher-risk projects use higher discount rates, resulting in lower NPVs and reflecting the greater uncertainty. This contrasts with the certainty equivalent method, which adjusts the cash flows rather than the rate.',

      'Changing all variables simultaneously',
      'Only adjusting the discount rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Sensitivity analysis changes one key variable at a time (e.g., sales volume, price, variable cost, discount rate) to determine the NPV\'s sensitivity to each input. This identifies which variables have the greatest impact on project value. Scenario analysis changes multiple variables simultaneously; Monte Carlo simulation uses probability distributions.',

      'Eliminates all uncertainty from the analysis',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Scenario analysis evaluates project outcomes under different scenarios (best case, worst case, most likely) by changing multiple input variables simultaneously. This provides a more realistic view than sensitivity analysis, which isolates individual variables. Common scenarios include optimistic, pessimistic, and base case.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Monte Carlo simulation assigns probability distributions to key inputs (sales, costs, growth rates, etc.) and runs thousands of iterations, randomly sampling from these distributions each time. The result is a probability distribution of NPV outcomes, showing the likelihood of different results—much richer information than a single-point estimate.',

    explanation: 'Post-audit (post-completion review) compares actual project performance to original projections. Benefits include: (1) improving future estimates by identifying systematic biases, (2) identifying corrective actions for current projects, (3) creating accountability that discourages optimistic bias, and (4) organizational learning. It should not be used punitively.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The EAA method converts each project\'s NPV into an equivalent annual cash flow stream. This is essential when comparing mutually exclusive projects with unequal lives that will be repeated. EAA = NPV / PVIFA(r, n). The project with the highest EAA should be selected. An alternative is the replacement chain (common life) approach.',

    question: 'When handling inflation in capital budgeting, the correct approach is to:',
    options: [
      'Always use nominal cash flows with nominal discount rates',
      'Match nominal cash flows with nominal rates OR real cash flows with real rates—never mix',
      'Use real cash flows with nominal discount rates to be conservative',
      'Ignore inflation since MACRS depreciation adjusts automatically',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The consistency principle requires matching: nominal (inflation-adjusted) cash flows must be discounted at nominal rates, and real (constant-dollar) cash flows must be discounted at real rates. Mixing them produces incorrect NPVs. Note that depreciation tax shields are fixed in nominal terms, so when using real cash flows, the depreciation shield must be treated separately and discounted at the nominal rate.',
