## Calculator Tips for Exam Day

### Before the Exam

3. **Clear all memories** before entering testing center
4. **Know shortcuts** for common calculations

### During the Exam
1. **Clear before each problem** - prevent carryover errors
2. **Double-check signs** - PV and FV have opposite signs
3. **Verify settings** - P/Y, C/Y, BGN/END
4. **Store intermediate results** - use memory

### Common Errors to Avoid
- Wrong sign convention (+/-)
- Forgetting to clear TVM
- Wrong number of periods
- Annual rate vs period rate

## Practice Problem

**Calculate NPV for a project:**
- Initial investment: $100,000
- Annual cash flows: $30,000 for 5 years
- Discount rate: 10%

**BA II Plus Steps:**
1. [CF] → Clear [2nd] [CLR WORK]
2. CF0 = -100000 [ENTER] [↓]
3. C01 = 30000 [ENTER] [↓]
4. F01 = 5 [ENTER] [↓]
5. [NPV] I = 10 [ENTER] [↓]
6. [CPT] → NPV = $13,723.60

**Answer**: NPV = $13,724 ✓
