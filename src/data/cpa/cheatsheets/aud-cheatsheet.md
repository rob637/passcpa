## Audit Risk Model

### Formula
```
Audit Risk = Inherent Risk × Control Risk × Detection Risk
AR = IR × CR × DR
```

### Components
| Risk | Definition | Auditor Control |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| Inherent Risk | Risk of misstatement before controls | Cannot change |
| Control Risk | Risk controls won't prevent/detect | Cannot change |
| Detection Risk | Risk auditor won't detect | CAN control |

### Key Relationship
- **Inverse relationship**: Higher assessed IR/CR → Lower acceptable DR → More substantive testing
- Detection risk is the only component auditors can directly control

---

## Audit Evidence

### AEIOU Characteristics
- **A**ppropriate: Relevant + Reliable
- **E**xternal sources more reliable
- **I**nternal sources more reliable with strong controls
- **O**riginal documents more reliable than copies
- **U**nexpected results require more investigation

### Reliability Hierarchy (Most to Least)
1. External evidence from third parties directly to auditor
2. External evidence obtained by client
3. Internal evidence with strong controls
4. Internal evidence with weak controls
5. Oral representations

### Procedures - **ARIC-VOICES**
- **A**nalytical procedures
- **R**ecalculation
- **I**nspection
- **C**onfirmation
- **V**ouching (recorded → source document)
- **O**bservation
- **I**nquiry
- **C**ounting (physical examination)
- **E**xamination
- **S**canning/Tracing (source → recorded)

---

## Management Assertions

### Transactions & Events (Period)
- **O**ccurrence
- **C**ompleteness
- **A**ccuracy
- **C**utoff
- **C**lassification

### Account Balances (Point in Time)
- **E**xistence
- **C**ompleteness
- **R**ights and Obligations
- **V**aluation and Allocation

### Presentation & Disclosure
- **O**ccurrence / Rights
- **C**ompleteness
- **C**lassification / Understandability
- **A**ccuracy / Valuation

---

## Internal Control (COSO Framework)

### Five Components - **CRIME**
1. **C**ontrol Environment (foundation/tone at top)
2. **R**isk Assessment
3. **I**nformation & Communication
4. **M**onitoring Activities
5. **E**xisting Control Activities

### Control Activities Types
- Authorization
- Segregation of duties
- Physical controls
- Information processing controls
- Performance reviews

### SOC Reports

| Report | Users | Subject Matter |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| SOC 1 | User auditors | Controls over financial reporting |
| SOC 2 Type I | Management/regulators | Security/availability - design only |
| SOC 2 Type II | Management/regulators | Security/availability - design + operating |
| SOC 3 | General public | Trust services - general use |

---

## Materiality

### Planning Materiality Levels
1. **Overall materiality**: Based on financial statement level
2. **Performance materiality**: 50-75% of overall (reduces risk of aggregate)
3. **Trivial amount**: Below which misstatements clearly inconsequential

### Benchmarks
| Benchmark | Percentage Range |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Net income | 5% |
| Total revenue | 0.5% - 1% |
| Total assets | 0.5% - 1% |
| Gross profit | 1% - 2% |
| Total equity | 1% - 2% |

---

## Sampling

### Nonstatistical vs Statistical

| Method | Characteristics |
|--------|-----------------|
| Nonstatistical | Auditor judgment for sample size/selection |
| Statistical | Mathematical precision, projectable results |

### Attribute Sampling (Tests of Controls)
- Purpose: Test deviation rate
- Risk: Risk of assessing control risk too LOW (Type II)
- Calculate: Sample deviation rate vs. tolerable deviation rate

### Variables Sampling (Substantive Testing)
- Purpose: Test monetary amounts
- Methods: MUS, Difference estimation, Ratio estimation
- Risk of incorrect acceptance (Type II) is the primary concern

---

## Audit Reports

### Unmodified (Clean) Opinion
- Financial statements are fairly stated in all material respects
- No material misstatements identified
- Adequate disclosures

### Modified Opinions

| Type | Material? | Pervasive? | When Used |
|------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Qualified | Yes | No | Misstatement or scope limitation |
| Adverse | Yes | Yes | Pervasive misstatements |
| Disclaimer | Yes | Yes | Pervasive scope limitation |

### Key Report Sections
1. Opinion (first paragraph)
2. Basis for Opinion
3. Key Audit Matters (if applicable)
4. Management's Responsibilities
5. Auditor's Responsibilities
6. Report on Internal Control (if integrated)

### Going Concern
- Management's responsibility to evaluate
- Look-ahead period: 12 months from financial statement date
- Substantial doubt → Evaluate mitigation plans
- Unresolved → Add emphasis-of-matter paragraph (unmodified) or consider qualified/adverse

---

## Ethics & Independence

### Conceptual Framework Threats
- **S**elf-interest
- **S**elf-review
- **A**dvocacy
- **F**amiliarity
- **I**ntimidation (or **U**ndue influence)

### Independence Requirements
**In Fact**: Actual objectivity/impartiality
**In Appearance**: Reasonable observer would consider auditor objective

### Prohibited Services (Attest Clients)
- Bookkeeping (if client can't oversee)
- Management functions
- Designing/implementing financial information systems
- Appraisal/valuation for material amounts
- Actuarial services
- Internal audit outsourcing
- Human resources functions
- Investment banking services
- Legal services

---

## Related Party Transactions

### Identification Procedures
- Inquire of management about related parties
- Review SEC filings and legal invoices
- Examine shareholder records
- Review material contracts

### Evaluation Considerations
- Business rationale
- Arms-length nature
- Proper authorization
- Adequate disclosure

---

## Subsequent Events

### Type I - Recognized
- Conditions existed at balance sheet date
- Adjust the financial statements
- Example: Settlement of litigation on existing case

### Type II - Non-recognized
- Conditions arose after balance sheet date
- Disclose only (don't adjust)
- Example: Fire destroys warehouse in January

### Auditor Responsibilities
- Perform procedures through report date
- Inquire about subsequent events
- Read minutes of meetings

---

## Key Numbers to Memorize

| Item | Threshold |
|------|-----------|
| Major federal program | > $750,000 federal expenditures |
| Single Audit threshold | $750,000+ federal expenditures |
| Going concern look-ahead | 12 months from FS date |
| Confirm A/R | No $ threshold - professional judgment |
| Sampling confidence | Typically 90-95% |
| Performance materiality | 50-75% of overall |

---

## Common Exam Traps

1. **Inquiry alone**: Never sufficient for significant matters
2. **Negative confirmations**: Only valid with low expected errors + strong controls
3. **Management representations**: Required but not sufficient evidence
4. **Emphasis-of-matter**: Doesn't change opinion (still unmodified)
5. **Other-matter paragraphs**: For scope, not FS issues
6. **Sampling risk**: Can be quantified with statistical, not nonstatistical
7. **Predecessor auditor**: Must grant permission to review workpapers
8. **Going concern**: Substantial doubt ≠ automatic adverse/qualified

---

## Mnemonics

- **CRIME**: COSO internal control components
- **ARIC-VOICES**: Audit procedures
- **OCCCC**: Transaction assertions (Occurrence, Completeness, Accuracy, Cutoff, Classification)
- **ECRV**: Balance assertions (Existence, Completeness, Rights, Valuation)
- **SSAFI**: Threat types (Self-interest, Self-review, Advocacy, Familiarity, Intimidation)
