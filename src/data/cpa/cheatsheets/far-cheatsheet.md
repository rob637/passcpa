## Revenue Recognition (ASC 606)

### Five-Step Model - **IPART**
1. **I**dentify the contract
2. **P**erformance obligations identified
3. **A**llocate transaction price
4. **R**ecognize revenue when (or as) satisfied
5. **T**ransaction price determined

### Key Concepts
| Concept | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Point in time | Control transfers at specific moment |
| Over time | Control transfers continuously |
| Variable consideration | Estimate using expected value or most likely |
| Contract modifications | Prospective or cumulative catch-up |

### Over-Time Recognition Criteria
- Customer simultaneously receives/consumes benefits
- Asset created with no alternative use + enforceable right to payment
- Customer controls asset as it's created

---

## Lease Accounting (ASC 842)

### Classification Criteria - **OWNES**
If ANY of these are met → Finance Lease:
- **O**wnership transfers at end
- **W**ritten purchase option (reasonably certain)
- **N**et present value ≥ 90% of fair value
- **E**conomic life: Lease term ≥ 75% of useful life
- **S**pecialized asset with no alternative use

### Initial Measurement

| Item | Lessee | Lessor |
|------|--------|--------|
| Lease liability | PV of lease payments | N/A |
| ROU Asset | Liability + initial costs - incentives | Depends on lease type |

### Discount Rate Priority
1. Rate implicit in lease (if determinable)
2. Lessee's incremental borrowing rate

---

## Financial Instruments

### Debt Securities Classification

| Category | Measurement | Unrealized G/L |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Trading | Fair Value | Income Statement |
| AFS | Fair Value | OCI (recycled to I/S on sale) |
| HTM | Amortized Cost | N/A |

### Equity Securities (ASC 321)
- **General Rule**: Fair value through net income
- **Exception**: Equity method (20-50%) or consolidation (>50%)
- **Practical Expedient**: Cost minus impairment (no fair value)

---

## Inventory

### Cost Flow Methods
| Method | COGS in Inflation | EI in Inflation |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| FIFO | Lower (older costs) | Higher (newer costs) |
| LIFO | Higher (newer costs) | Lower (older costs) |
| Weighted Avg | Middle | Middle |

### Lower of Cost or NRV
- **NRV** = Selling price - Costs to complete - Costs to sell
- Write down to NRV; subsequent recovery allowed (up to original cost)
- LIFO/Retail: Use LCM (floor = NRV - normal profit; ceiling = NRV)

---

## Long-Lived Assets

### Capitalization vs Expense
**Capitalize:**
- Acquisition costs
- Additions
- Improvements/betterments extending useful life
- Major repairs (if extending life or adding value)

**Expense:**
- Repairs and maintenance
- Rearrangement costs (generally)

### Depreciation Methods
| Method | Formula |
|--------|---------|
| Straight-Line | (Cost - Salvage) ÷ Life |
| Double Declining | 2 × (1/Life) × Book Value |
| Units of Production | (Cost - Salvage) × (Units Used ÷ Total Units) |

### Impairment Testing
**Step 1 - Recoverability Test**: Is carrying value > undiscounted cash flows?
**Step 2 - If Yes**: Write down to fair value

---

## Intangible Assets

### Indefinite vs Finite Life
| Type | Amortization | Impairment |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Finite Life | Yes, over useful life | Two-step test |
| Indefinite Life | No | Annual fair value test |

### Goodwill
- Acquired in business combinations only
- Not amortized
- Tested annually for impairment
- Impairment: Carrying value > Fair value of reporting unit

---

## Stockholders' Equity

### Treasury Stock Methods
| Method | Purchase | Reissue Above Cost | Reissue Below Cost |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Cost | Dr. Treasury Stock (cost) | Cr. APIC for excess | Dr. APIC first, then RE |
| Par | Dr. Treasury (par), APIC | Cr. APIC | Dr. APIC |

### Stock Dividends vs Splits
| Type | < 20-25% | > 20-25% | 100% Increase |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Stock Dividend | FMV recorded | Par value only | N/A |
| Stock Split | No journal entry | No journal entry | 2-for-1 |

### Retained Earnings Components
- Net income increases RE
- Dividends decrease RE
- Prior period adjustments (net of tax) adjust beginning RE

---

## Earnings Per Share

### Basic EPS
```
Net Income - Preferred Dividends
─────────────────────────────────
Weighted Average Common Shares
```

### Diluted EPS
- Include all potentially dilutive securities
- **Treasury Stock Method**: Options, warrants
- **If-Converted Method**: Convertible bonds/preferred
- Anti-dilution test: Don't include if EPS increases

---

## Key Numbers to Memorize

| Lease classification - Life test | ≥ 75% of useful life |
| Equity method influence | 20-50% ownership |
| Consolidation | > 50% or control |
| Research costs | Expense as incurred |
| Development costs | Expense (GAAP) / Capitalize after technical feasibility (software) |
| Goodwill impairment | Annual test required |
| Segment reporting | 10% test |

---

## Common Exam Traps

1. **Lease modifications**: Remeasure liability at new rate
2. **Stock dividends**: Small = FMV, Large = Par only
3. **Impairment**: Goodwill uses one-step; long-lived uses two-step
4. **Debt issuance costs**: Netted against liability (not asset)
5. **Revenue recognition**: Variable consideration uses constraint
6. **Gov't budgetary entries**: Debit Estimated Revenues, Credit Appropriations
7. **NFP contributions**: Time restrictions ≠ conditions

---

## Mnemonics

- **IPART**: Revenue recognition 5-step model
- **OWNES**: Finance lease criteria
- **CFRPT**: Current ratio, Quick ratio, Inventory turnover, A/R turnover, Days in inventory
- **GRaSPP**: Government-wide, Reconciliation, and Statement of Position/Proprietary
