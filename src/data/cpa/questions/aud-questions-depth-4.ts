      'Location threat',
      'Self-review threat — performing non-audit services that are then subject to audit (e.g., preparing financial statements then auditing them)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'AICPA Independence framework — seven categories of threats: (1) Self-review — auditing your own work, (2) Advocacy — promoting/appearing to promote the client\'s position, (3) Adverse interest — interests in conflict with the client, (4) Familiarity — close/long-standing relationships, (5) Undue influence — threats/coercion from the client, (6) Management participation — taking on management responsibilities, (7) Self-interest — financial interest in the client. Safeguards are applied to reduce threats to an acceptable level. If no safeguard can reduce the threat: the engagement should not be accepted (or the relationship must be terminated).',

Examples: ownership of stock/bonds, ownership of beneficial interest in a trust with client securities. Applies to: the CPA, the CPA\'s immediate family (spouse, dependent). Indirect financial interest: impairs independence only if MATERIAL to the CPA. Examples: mutual fund that holds client stock (unless the CPA can influence the fund\'s investment decisions).

(3) Review (AR-C §90): limited assurance, report issued. Independence IS required. (4) Audit (AU-C §700): reasonable assurance, opinion issued. Independence IS required. Key differences: Reviews require inquiry and analytical procedures (substantive work).

Preparation and compilation engagements do not have these explicit requirements.',

This principle is the foundation for independence rules about non-audit services for audit clients.',
