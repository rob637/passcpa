      'Inherent risk × control risk × detection risk',
      'Inherent risk + control risk + detection risk',
      'Inherent risk / detection risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The audit risk model: Audit Risk = Inherent Risk × Control Risk × Detection Risk. Inherent risk (IR): susceptibility of an assertion to material misstatement, assuming no controls. Control risk (CR): risk that internal controls fail to prevent/detect the misstatement. Detection risk (DR): risk that audit procedures fail to detect the misstatement. The auditor sets an acceptable level of audit risk and adjusts detection risk based on assessed inherent and control risk. Higher assessed IR and CR → lower acceptable DR → more extensive audit procedures needed.',

      'The auditor disagrees with management\'s estimates',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under AU-C 315.28, a significant risk is an assessed risk of material misstatement that requires SPECIAL AUDIT CONSIDERATION. Factors indicating a significant risk include: (1) Whether it is a risk of FRAUD. (2) Whether it relates to significant NON-ROUTINE transactions. (3) Whether it involves significant JUDGMENT or ESTIMATION. (4) Whether it relates to related-party transactions outside the normal course of business. Revenue recognition is PRESUMED to be a significant risk (AU-C 240.27). Management override of controls is ALWAYS a significant risk. The auditor responds to significant risks with specifically designed procedures, including testing controls (if relying on them) in the CURRENT period — not just relying on prior-year tests.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'COSO identifies five interrelated components of internal control (mnemonic: CRIME or CE-RI-CA-IC-MA): (1) Control Environment — tone at the top, governance, organizational structure. (2) Risk Assessment — entity\'s process for identifying and analyzing risks. (3) Control Activities — policies and procedures ensuring management directives are carried out. (4) Information and Communication — identifying, capturing, and communicating relevant information. (5) Monitoring Activities — ongoing evaluations and separate evaluations of IC effectiveness. "External verification" is NOT a component — it is an audit procedure, not an internal control component. The control environment is the FOUNDATION of all other components.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under AU-C 320.09, performance materiality is set at an amount LESS THAN overall (financial statement) materiality. Its purpose is to reduce the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Performance materiality accounts for the fact that: (1) The auditor may not detect ALL misstatements. (2) Multiple individually immaterial misstatements can aggregate to a material amount. The amount of the reduction depends on the auditor\'s professional judgment, considering: (a) understanding of the entity, (b) updated risk assessments, (c) nature and extent of misstatements identified in prior audits. Typical practice sets performance materiality at 50%–75% of overall materiality.',

This understanding drives the nature, timing, and extent of further audit procedures. Key areas to understand include: the entity\'s industry and regulatory environment, nature of the entity (operations, ownership, governance, investments), accounting policies, objectives/strategies/business risks, and the entity\'s internal control.

(3) Board of directors and audit committee participation. (4) Management philosophy and operating style. (5) Organizational structure. (6) Assignment of authority and responsibility. (7) Human resource policies and practices. Physical safeguards over assets and bank reconciliations are CONTROL ACTIVITIES (not the control environment). Segregation of duties is also a control activity. The control environment is the foundation — it sets the tone for the organization and influences the control consciousness of employees.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under AU-C 315.06, the three categories of RISK ASSESSMENT PROCEDURES are: (1) Inquiries of management and others within the entity — to gather information about operations, risks, controls, fraud, etc. (2) Analytical procedures — analyzing relationships among financial and nonfinancial data to identify unusual items, unexpected trends, or anomalies. (3) Observation and inspection — observing entity operations/processes and inspecting documents, records, and internal control manuals. CONFIRMATIONS (external) are SUBSTANTIVE procedures, performed to test assertions — not risk assessment procedures. Risk assessment procedures provide a basis for identifying and assessing risks; substantive procedures respond to assessed risks by testing whether misstatements exist.',

      '0.5% of total equity only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under AU-C 320.A8, common benchmarks for determining materiality include: (1) 5% of income from continuing operations (before tax) — most commonly used for profit-oriented entities. (2) 0.5% to 1% of total revenue — for entities with volatile or low earnings. (3) 1% to 2% of total assets — for asset-intensive entities (banks, insurance companies). (4) 1% to 5% of equity — for entities where equity is a key metric. The selection of benchmark depends on: (a) elements of the financial statements that users focus on, (b) the entity\'s nature, (c) ownership structure, (d) financing, (e) volatility of the benchmark. Materiality involves professional JUDGMENT — there is no single required formula.',

      'Only affect the footnote disclosures',
      'Are always low risk',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under AU-C 315.27, risks assessed at the financial statement level are PERVASIVE — they are not specific to individual assertions but affect the financial statements as a whole. Examples include: (1) Management integrity issues. (2) Weak control environment. (3) Going concern doubts. (4) Significant unusual transactions outside the normal course. (5) Competency issues in the accounting function. The auditor responds to financial statement level risks with OVERALL responses (e.g., increasing professional skepticism, assigning more experienced staff, providing more supervision, incorporating additional unpredictability in procedures). In contrast, assertion-level risks relate to SPECIFIC classes of transactions, account balances, or disclosures and are addressed with specifically designed further audit procedures.',

      'Marketing',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Segregation of duties is a fundamental control activity. The three incompatible functions that should be separated are: (1) AUTHORIZATION — approving transactions (e.g., approving purchase orders, authorizing credit sales). (2) CUSTODY — physical access to assets (e.g., handling cash, accessing inventory, signing checks). (3) RECORDING — accounting for transactions (e.g., recording entries in the journal, maintaining the general ledger). When one person performs two or more of these functions, the risk of fraud or error increases because the person can both commit and conceal irregularities. For example, if the person who handles cash receipts also records them, they could misappropriate cash and conceal it with fictitious entries.',

    explanation: 'Under AU-C 240.A1, the fraud triangle consists of three conditions: (1) INCENTIVE/PRESSURE — motivation to commit fraud (e.g., financial targets, personal debt, bonus structures). (2) OPPORTUNITY — circumstances that allow fraud to occur (e.g., weak internal controls, lack of segregation of duties, management override). (3) RATIONALIZATION/ATTITUDE — the ability to justify the fraudulent action (e.g., "I\'ll pay it back," "I deserve it," "everyone does it"). The auditor considers fraud risk factors related to both types of fraud: (a) Fraudulent financial reporting (manipulating financial statements). (b) Misappropriation of assets (theft). These conditions inform the auditor\'s assessment of fraud risk and the design of procedures to address assessed risks.',

Categories include: (1) Access security — logical and physical access controls. (2) Program change management — controls over changes to programs and systems. (3) Computer operations — job scheduling, backup/recovery, incident management. (4) Program development — SDLC controls, testing, authorization. ITGCs support application controls — if ITGCs are ineffective, application controls may not function reliably. IT Application Controls: specific to individual applications/processes — input controls (edit checks, validation), processing controls (completeness, accuracy), output controls (distribution, reconciliation).

    explanation: 'Inherent limitations of internal control include: (1) MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE — management can circumvent or override controls, which is why it is always a fraud risk. (2) Human error — mistakes in judgment, fatigue, distraction. (3) Collusion — two or more people working together can circumvent segregation of duties. (4) Cost-benefit constraints — controls should not cost more than the benefit they provide. (5) Unusual or non-routine transactions that existing controls may not address. Management override is particularly significant because it means that even well-designed controls can be rendered ineffective by the people who operate the system. This is why AU-C 240 requires the auditor to address management override of controls as a PRESUMED fraud risk in every audit.',

It defines internal control, identifies the five components (control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information/communication, monitoring), and includes 17 principles. COSO is the framework most commonly used by U.S. public companies to comply with SOX Section 404 (internal control reporting). COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) is a separate framework focused specifically on IT governance and management, often used as a complement to COSO for IT controls.',

      'Rely entirely on internal controls',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under AU-C 200.17, professional skepticism is an attitude that includes a QUESTIONING MIND, being alert to conditions that may indicate possible misstatement due to error or fraud, and a CRITICAL ASSESSMENT of audit evidence. The auditor does not: (a) assume management is dishonest, NOR (b) assume unquestioned honesty. Professional skepticism is maintained throughout the audit and includes: recognizing that a material misstatement could exist despite past experience of honesty, being alert to contradictory evidence, questioning the reliability of documents, and considering the sufficiency/appropriateness of evidence obtained. It is fundamental to the quality of an audit and is especially critical in areas involving management estimates and judgments.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A walkthrough involves tracing ONE or more transactions from INITIATION through the entire process to RECORDING in the financial statements (and related controls along the way). Walkthroughs help the auditor: (1) Confirm their understanding of the transaction flow, including initiation, authorization, recording, processing, and reporting. (2) Confirm their understanding of the DESIGN of related controls. (3) Confirm whether controls have been PLACED IN OPERATION (implemented). Walkthroughs are typically performed during the risk assessment phase. They are especially useful for understanding significant classes of transactions and their related controls. Walkthroughs are required for ICFR audits (PCAOB AS 2201.34-.35) and strongly encouraged for financial statement audits.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under AU-C 240.27 and 240.32: (1) Revenue recognition: PRESUMED fraud risk — the auditor should ordinarily presume that improper revenue recognition is a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. If the auditor concludes it does not apply, the reasons must be documented. (2) Management override of controls: ALWAYS a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. Required responses include: (a) testing the appropriateness of JOURNAL ENTRIES and other adjustments, (b) reviewing ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES for bias, (c) evaluating the business rationale for significant UNUSUAL TRANSACTIONS. These presumptions are mandatory — the auditor cannot overcome the management override risk (it is always present).',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under COSO\'s Internal Control Framework, monitoring activities assess whether the FIVE components of internal control are present and functioning effectively. Two types: (1) ONGOING evaluations: built into normal operations — supervisory review, management review, reconciliations, automated checks. These occur in real-time as part of daily operations. (2) SEPARATE evaluations: periodic assessments — internal audit department reviews, self-assessments, peer reviews, external assessments. The scope/frequency depends on the significance of risks, rate of change, and competence of personnel. Deficiencies identified through monitoring are communicated to parties responsible for corrective action, including management and the board/audit committee for significant deficiencies.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under AU-C 450.A4 and AU-C 320.A3, qualitative considerations may make a quantitatively immaterial misstatement MATERIAL. Examples include: (1) Misstatement changes a reported loss to income (or vice versa). (2) Misstatement affects COMPLIANCE with debt covenants, regulatory requirements, or contractual obligations. (3) Misstatement involves CONCEALMENT of an unlawful transaction. (4) Misstatement affects TRENDS — e.g., turning a declining trend into an increasing trend. (5) Misstatement affects management COMPENSATION metrics (e.g., bonuses). (6) Misstatement masks a CHANGE in earnings patterns. (7) Misstatement relates to segment reporting or other significant disclosures. The interaction of quantitative and qualitative factors requires auditor judgment.',
