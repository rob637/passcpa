    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'SSARS (AR-C §80): Compilation = presenting financial statements based on information provided by management. No assurance is expressed. The accountant is not required to verify the accuracy or completeness of the information. The compilation report states that the accountant did not audit or review the financial statements and, accordingly, does not express an opinion or provide any assurance. Key requirements: (1) engagement letter required, (2) knowledge of the industry, (3) read the financial statements for obvious material misstatements. Independence is NOT required (but must disclose lack of independence).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'AR-C §80.21: Independence is NOT required for compilations (unlike audits and reviews). If the accountant is not independent, the compilation may still be performed, but a disclosure must be added to the compilation report. The accountant may (but is not required to) disclose the reason for the lack of independence. Example wording: "I am (We are) not independent with respect to XYZ Company."

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'SSARS review (AR-C §90): Limited assurance engagement. Procedures: primarily inquiry of management and analytical procedures (comparing relationships, investigating unexpected fluctuations). No testing of internal controls, no confirmation of receivables, no physical inventory observation (those are audit procedures). The conclusion is expressed in negative form: "I am not aware of any material modifications that should be made." Independence IS required for reviews (unlike compilations). A review provides substantially less assurance than an audit.',

      'Requires independence',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'AR-C §70 (preparation engagement): Lowest level of service. The accountant prepares financial statements using management\'s information. No report is required (unlike compilation, review, or audit). Each page must include: "No assurance is provided on these financial statements." Independence NOT required. Engagement letter IS required. If the accountant cannot include the legend on each page (e.g., electronic), the engagement must be at least a compilation.

Step 2: Identify Type B programs (all others). Step 3: Assess risk — Type A programs are major unless low-risk (audited in at least one of the last 2 years with no findings).

Step 5: Calculate percentage of coverage — at least 20% (40% if low-risk auditee) of total federal awards must be covered by major programs tested.',

    explanation: 'AU-C §600 (Group Audits): The group engagement partner can either: (1) Make reference — opinion is NOT modified, but the group auditor\'s report identifies the component auditor and indicates the magnitude of the portion audited (percentage of total assets and revenues). Divides responsibility between auditors. (2) Not make reference — group auditor assumes full responsibility for the entire audit. Must then perform additional procedures (evaluate component auditor\'s work, review working papers, perform supplemental procedures). Reference decision depends on: materiality of component, knowledge of component auditor, risk assessment.',

If below that threshold but not frivolous, the position may be taken if adequately disclosed (Form 8275 or 8275-R).
