    options: [
      'The control is operating effectively because 0% deviation was found',
      'The control is operating effectively because the sample upper deviation rate (4.9%) does not exceed the tolerable rate (5%)',
      'The control cannot be relied upon because the upper deviation rate is too close to the tolerable rate',
      'The sample is too small to draw any conclusion',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'In attribute sampling, the auditor compares the computed upper deviation rate (UDR) to the tolerable rate. Since 4.9% < 5%, the sample supports the planned level of reliance on the control. However, the 0.1% margin is narrow—the auditor may consider whether to increase the sample for additional comfort, but statistically the result supports reliance.',
