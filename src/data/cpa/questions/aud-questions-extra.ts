      'The auditor should recommend specific IT improvements but need not modify the audit plan',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When programmers have access to production and change management is informal, the risk of unauthorized modifications to programs processing financial data increases significantly. This IT general control weakness undermines reliance on application controls dependent on those programs. The auditor should: (1) assess the impact on financial statement assertions, (2) likely not rely on automated controls, and (3) expand substantive testing of accounts processed by affected systems.',

    question: 'During testing of controls over cash disbursements, an auditor finds that 3 of 40 sampled checks were signed by an unauthorized person, though the amounts were proper and supported. How should the auditor classify this finding?',
    options: [
      'De minimis exception requiring no further action',
      'Significant deficiency — the control deviation represents a reasonable possibility of a material misstatement',
      'Material weakness — any breakdown in authorization controls',
      'Control deficiency that is not a significant deficiency because no misstatement resulted',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A 7.5% deviation rate in an authorization control represents a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement could occur and not be prevented or detected. While no actual misstatement was found, the control failure increases risk. This meets the threshold for a significant deficiency (not yet a material weakness, which requires a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement would NOT be detected).',

    explanation: 'Under AR-C 80.11, the CPA must obtain an understanding of the client\'s business (including accounting principles and practices used in the industry) sufficient to compile the financial statements.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation:
      'Under SSARS, independence is required for review engagements (AR-C 90) because limited assurance is provided. For compilations (AR-C 80), independence is not required, but lack of independence must be disclosed in the report. For preparations (AR-C 70), independence is also not required.
