    question: 'A CPA firm provides audit services to Client A. The CPA firm also provides bookkeeping services and prepares financial statements for Client A. Under AICPA rules, what safeguard is required to maintain independence?',
    options: [
      'Obtain written consent from the client',
      'Ensure management takes responsibility for the financial statements and has sufficient expertise',
      'Independence is automatically impaired; firm must withdraw from audit',
      'Assign different partners to each engagement'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Nonattest services (like bookkeeping) for attest clients require: (1) client agrees to assume all management responsibilities, (2) client has member of management with sufficient expertise to oversee the service, (3) CPA does not make management decisions. These are the general requirements under AICPA\'s revised interpretation.',

      'Serving as an expert witness for an audit client',
      'Providing internal audit outsourcing services to an audit client'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Self-interest threat: member could benefit from a financial interest in the client. Direct financial interest (owning stock) creates a self-interest threat and impairs independence regardless of materiality. Litigation support = advocacy threat. Expert witness depends on context.',

    explanation: 'Covered members include: individuals on the attest engagement team, those in a position to influence the engagement, partners/managers who provide nonattest services to the client, and the firm. A partner in the same office who has no connection to the client is not automatically a covered member.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Larger sample required when: (1) expected deviation rate INCREASES, (2) tolerable rate DECREASES (lower tolerance = more precision needed), (3) risk of assessing control risk too low DECREASES (want more assurance). Higher expected deviation rate means more testing needed.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'MUS (PPS sampling) uses individual dollars as sampling units. Larger accounts are more likely to be selected (proportional to size). This automatically focuses on higher-risk items without manual stratification. It\'s efficient for testing for overstatement.',
