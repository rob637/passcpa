    question: 'A company has current assets of $500,000, inventory of $200,000, and current liabilities of $250,000. What is the quick ratio?',

      '1.2',
      '0.8',
      '2.0',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Quick ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities = ($500,000 - $200,000) / $250,000 = 1.2. This measures liquidity without relying on inventory conversion.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'FCFF = EBIT × (1 − Tax Rate) + Depreciation − CapEx − Change in NWC. FCFF = $5,000,000 × (1 − 0.25) + $1,200,000 − $800,000 − $300,000 = $3,750,000 + $1,200,000 − $800,000 − $300,000 = $3,850,000.

    question: 'Parker Corp. (lessee) enters a 4-year lease for office space with annual payments of $120,000. The building has a 30-year useful life and fair value of $2,000,000. There is no transfer of ownership or purchase option. The present value of lease payments is $415,000. How should this lease be classified?',
    options: [
      'Finance lease — the PV exceeds 90% of fair value',
      'Finance lease — all real estate leases are finance leases',
      'Operating lease — no finance lease criteria are met',
      'Short-term lease — the term is under 5 years',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-10-25-2, this is an operating lease because none of the five finance lease criteria are met: (1) no ownership transfer, (2) no purchase option, (3) 4-year term is not a major part of 30-year useful life, (4) PV of $415,000 is only 20.75% of $2,000,000 fair value (well below 90%), and (5) the office space is not specialized.

      '$825,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-20-30, the initial ROU asset = lease liability (PV of payments) + initial direct costs + prepaid lease payments − lease incentives received. ROU = $800,000 + $25,000 + $30,000 − $50,000 = $805,000. Initial direct costs are incremental costs of obtaining the lease. Lease incentives reduce the ROU asset. Prepaid amounts increase it.',
