    question: 'Under ASU 2020-06, convertible debt instruments are generally accounted for:',
    options: [
      'By separating the debt and equity components and recording each at fair value',
      'As a single liability measured at amortized cost, unless: (1) the instrument has embedded features requiring bifurcation under ASC 815, or (2) it is issued with a substantial premium',
      'Entirely as equity',
      'At fair value through profit or loss in all cases',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2020-06 (effective 2022 for public companies) simplified convertible debt accounting by eliminating: (1) the beneficial conversion feature (BCF) model, and (2) the cash conversion model (which had separated convertible debt into debt and equity components). Under the new guidance, convertible debt is generally accounted for as a single unit of account — a liability measured at amortized cost, unless the conversion option required bifurcation as a derivative under ASC 815. This change increased reported debt (no equity component carved out), increased interest expense (no longer amortize a discount from the carve-out), and simplified the accounting. The if-converted method is now required for all convertible instruments in diluted EPS.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 360 long-lived asset impairment, two-step process: Step 1 (Recoverability test): Compare carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) to the sum of estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from its use and eventual disposition. If undiscounted cash flows ≥ carrying amount → no impairment (stop). If undiscounted cash flows < carrying amount → asset is impaired → proceed to Step 2. Step 2 (Measurement): Impairment loss = Carrying amount − Fair value. The asset is written down to fair value, which becomes its new cost basis. The impairment loss is reported in income from continuing operations. The new cost basis is NOT written back up if fair value later increases (no reversal under GAAP, unlike IFRS). Asset groups are the lowest level of identifiable cash flows.',

    explanation: 'CECL (ASC 326-20, effective for SEC filers 2020, others 2023) replaced the incurred loss model with a forward-looking expected loss model. Key changes: (1) Recognize lifetime expected losses at inception (Day 1 allowance) rather than waiting for a loss to be "incurred," (2) Consider past events, current conditions, AND reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions, (3) Applies to financial assets at amortized cost (loans, held-to-maturity securities, trade receivables, reinsurance receivables). The allowance reflects expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life (adjusted for expected prepayments, not renewals unless unconditional right exists). Methods include vintage analysis, probability of default/loss given default, discounted cash flow, and loss-rate methods.',

Examples of strategic shifts: disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other major parts of an entity. Presentation: results of discontinued operations are reported separately (after income from continuing operations, net of tax). Assets and liabilities of held-for-sale disposal groups are presented separately on the balance sheet.

The transaction price is adjusted to reflect what the customer would have paid in cash at the time of transfer (discount long-term payments, or add interest for prepayments). Practical expedient: no adjustment needed if the period between transfer and payment is one year or less. Also no adjustment if: payment is variable based on factors outside either party\'s control, or the difference is for non-financing reasons (e.g., retainage for performance protection).

They are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate fair value may be below carrying amount. The impairment test is a one-step comparison: if carrying amount > fair value → impairment loss = difference. An optional qualitative assessment may be performed first to determine whether it is more likely than not that fair value is below carrying amount. If it is not more likely than not, no quantitative test is needed. The entity must reassess the useful life each period — if no longer indefinite, start amortizing.',

The original lease accounting continues unchanged, and the new right of use is treated as a separate lease. If the modification does NOT meet these criteria, the lessee must remeasure the lease liability, reassess classification, and potentially adjust the ROU asset. Additional right-of-use modifications at a discount, or modifications that decrease scope, are always accounted for by remeasuring the existing lease.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Push-down accounting (ASC 805-50): When a change-in-control event occurs (e.g., subsidiary is acquired), the subsidiary may (optional election) adjust its own standalone financial statements to reflect the acquirer\'s new basis. This means the subsidiary records: (1) fair value adjustments to assets and liabilities, (2) goodwill from the acquisition, (3) elimination of the subsidiary\'s pre-acquisition equity. The election is available at each change-in-control event and, once elected, is irrevocable. Push-down is primarily relevant for subsidiaries that issue separate public financial statements (e.g., SEC filers with public debt). It simplifies consolidation because the subsidiary\'s books already reflect the acquisition-date fair values.',

Mandatorily redeemable financial instruments: if the issuer has an unconditional obligation to redeem by transferring assets at a specified or determinable date or upon an event that is certain to occur → classified as a liability. Examples: preferred stock with mandatory redemption, partnership interests subject to mandatory repurchase. The obligation must be unconditional and not contingent on events that may not occur.

      'Using the CECL lifetime expected loss model',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 326-30 changed AFS debt security impairment: Instead of the old "other-than-temporary impairment" (OTTI) model, credit losses are now recognized through an allowance for credit losses (ACL). The allowance is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost. Credit loss = amortized cost − PV of expected cash flows (discounted at the security\'s effective interest rate). Non-credit-related decline (market conditions, interest rate changes) continues to be recorded in OCI. Key benefit: credit losses are reversible through the allowance if conditions improve (unlike the old OTTI model which was a permanent write-down through income for the credit portion). The AFS model is different from the CECL model used for amortized-cost instruments.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'If a customer option provides a material right (a right the customer would not receive without the contract), it is a separate performance obligation under ASC 606. A material right exists when the discount on future purchases is incremental to discounts typically available. Examples: loyalty points programs, contract renewal options at a discount, free or discounted goods on future purchases. The entity allocates a portion of the transaction price to the material right based on the standalone selling price of the option (considering both the discount and the likelihood of exercise). Revenue allocated to the material right is deferred until the option is exercised or expires. Volume discounts available to ALL customers are generally NOT material rights.',

Enhanced disclosures are required for modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, including: type of modification (term extension, interest rate reduction, principal forgiveness), financial effects, and performance of modified loans.

If bifurcated, the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value per ASC 815. Examples requiring bifurcation: equity-indexed interest payments in a debt host, commodity-linked payments in a service contract not related to the service.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'In upstream transactions (subsidiary to parent), the subsidiary is the seller and recognized the intercompany profit. The unrealized profit elimination affects the consolidated income attributable to both the controlling interest (parent) and the noncontrolling interest (NCI) proportionately, because the subsidiary\'s earnings are shared between the parent and NCI. For example, if the parent owns 80% and NCI is 20%, and unrealized upstream profit is $100: the parent\'s share of elimination = $80, NCI\'s share = $20. In downstream transactions (parent to subsidiary), the parent is the seller, so 100% of unrealized profit elimination is against the parent (NCI is not affected). This difference is a key tested concept in consolidation.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017) changed NOL rules for losses arising after 2017: (1) No carryback (with some exceptions, e.g., farming losses, certain insurance companies; also the CARES Act temporarily allowed 5-year carryback for 2018-2020 losses), (2) Indefinite carryforward period (previously 20 years), (3) 80% limitation — NOLs can offset only 80% of taxable income in any carryforward year (previously 100%). The 80% limitation does not apply to NOLs arising before 2018 (pre-TCJA losses follow old rules). For deferred tax asset purposes, the DTA includes both the carryforward benefit and any valuation allowance assessment. The indefinite carryforward period means NOLs do not expire and a DTA is measured at the enacted tax rate.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Finance lease P&L treatment: (1) Amortization of the ROU asset — typically straight-line over the shorter of the useful life or lease term (unless title transfers or purchase option is reasonably certain, then amortize over useful life). (2) Interest expense — calculated using the effective interest method on the outstanding lease liability (higher in early periods when the liability is largest, declining as payments are made). The combined effect is front-loaded expense (higher total expense in early periods, lower in later periods). This contrasts with operating leases, which recognize a single straight-line lease expense. Both types have the same total expense over the lease term; only the timing pattern differs.',
