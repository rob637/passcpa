      'The production budget',
      'The capital expenditure budget',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The sales budget is the foundation of the master budget because most other budgets flow from expected sales volume. Sequence: Sales budget → Production budget → Direct materials, Direct labor, Manufacturing overhead budgets → Cost of goods sold budget → Selling & admin budget → Pro forma income statement → Cash budget → Pro forma balance sheet. The sales forecast drives the entire planning process.',

    explanation: 'A flexible budget recalculates expected costs for the actual output level, enabling meaningful comparison with actual results. Static budget variance = Actual − Static budget (based on planned volume). Flexible budget variance = Actual − Flexible budget (based on actual volume). Sales volume variance = Flexible budget − Static budget. The flexible budget isolates efficiency/spending variances from volume variances, providing better performance evaluation.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'ZBB requires managers to justify every dollar from scratch each period, as if building the budget from zero. Decision packages rank activities by priority and cost-benefit. Benefits: eliminates budget slack and unnecessary spending, forces critical evaluation. Drawbacks: extremely time-consuming, may cause political conflicts, difficult to implement annually. Many organizations use ZBB periodically (every 3-5 years) rather than annually, or apply it selectively to specific departments.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Beyond Budgeting (developed by the BBRT) critiques traditional budgets as outdated command-and-control tools. Key principles: (1) replace fixed annual targets with relative/competitive benchmarks, (2) use rolling forecasts (continuously updated 12-18 months), (3) decentralize authority to front-line teams, (4) allocate resources dynamically rather than through budget negotiations, (5) use peer-based performance evaluation.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Kaizen costing focuses on continuous, incremental cost reduction during manufacturing. Unlike standard costing (which sets a fixed standard and measures variance), kaizen sets progressively tighter cost reduction targets each period. Target costing occurs during product design/development; kaizen costing occurs during production. Key difference: standard costing asks "How much should it cost?" while kaizen asks "How much less can it cost this period?"

Formula: (1) Complete beginning WIP: beginning WIP units × (100% − % complete at start), (2) Units started and completed during the period (= units transferred out − beginning WIP units), (3) Ending WIP: ending WIP units × % complete. By contrast, weighted-average treats all units as if started during the current period. FIFO is more accurate for performance evaluation since it isolates current period efficiency.',

    question: 'Competitive benchmarking involves:',
    options: [
      'Comparing internal departments with each other',
      'Comparing the organization\'s processes and performance metrics against best-in-class competitors or industry leaders',
      'Setting arbitrary performance targets',
      'Only analyzing financial statements of competitors',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Benchmarking types: (1) Internal — comparing similar processes within the organization, (2) Competitive — comparing against direct competitors, (3) Functional — comparing similar functions across different industries, (4) Generic/Best-in-class — comparing processes with the best performers regardless of industry. Benchmarking steps: plan, collect data, analyze gaps, implement improvements, monitor results. It drives continuous improvement by identifying performance gaps and learning from superior performers.',

    question: 'A company expects to sell 10,000 units. Beginning finished goods inventory is 1,500 units and desired ending inventory is 2,000 units. How many units must be produced?',
    options: [
      '10,000 units',
      '10,500 units',
      '11,500 units',
      '9,500 units',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Production budget: Units to produce = Budgeted sales + Desired ending FG inventory − Beginning FG inventory = 10,000 + 2,000 − 1,500 = 10,500 units. This ensures enough inventory to meet sales demand while achieving the target ending inventory level. The production budget drives the direct materials purchases budget, direct labor budget, and manufacturing overhead budget.',

    question: 'Standard labor: 2 hours at $20/hour per unit. Actual: 2,100 hours at $21/hour for 1,000 units. The labor rate variance is:',
    options: [
      '$2,100 unfavorable',
      '$2,100 favorable',
      '$2,000 unfavorable',
      '$1,000 unfavorable',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Labor Rate Variance = (Actual Rate − Standard Rate) × Actual Hours = ($21 − $20) × 2,100 = $2,100 Unfavorable (paid more than standard). Labor Efficiency Variance = (Actual Hours − Standard Hours) × Standard Rate = (2,100 − 2,000) × $20 = $2,000 Unfavorable (used more hours than standard). Rate variances may be caused by wage increases, different skill-level workers, or overtime premiums. Efficiency variances may result from poor training, machine breakdowns, or material quality issues.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Fixed OH Volume Variance = Budgeted Fixed OH − Applied Fixed OH = Budgeted Fixed OH − (Standard rate × Standard hours allowed for actual output). Favorable when actual production exceeds the planned denominator volume (overhead is "over-applied"). This variance reflects capacity utilization, not spending efficiency. Fixed OH Spending Variance = Actual Fixed OH − Budgeted Fixed OH — reflects actual spending differences. Four-way OH analysis: Variable spending, Variable efficiency, Fixed spending, Fixed volume.',
