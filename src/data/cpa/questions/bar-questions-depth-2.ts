      'The capital expenditure budget',
      'The sales budget',
      'The production budget',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The sales budget is the foundation of the master budget because most other budgets flow from expected sales volume. Sequence: Sales budget → Production budget → Direct materials, Direct labor, Manufacturing overhead budgets → Cost of goods sold budget → Selling & admin budget → Pro forma income statement → Cash budget → Pro forma balance sheet. The sales forecast drives the entire planning process.',

    question: 'Norton Corp. originally budgeted 10,000 units at a variable cost of $8 per unit with fixed costs of $150,000. Actual production was 12,000 units. What is the flexible budget for total costs at the actual activity level?',
    options: [

      '$246,000',
      '$180,000',
      '$270,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A flexible budget adjusts variable costs to the actual activity level while holding fixed costs constant. Variable costs = 12,000 units × $8 = $96,000. Fixed costs = $150,000 (unchanged). Flexible budget total = $96,000 + $150,000 = $246,000. This differs from the static budget ($80,000 + $150,000 = $230,000) because the flexible budget reflects the actual volume of 12,000 units.',

    question: 'Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) differs from incremental budgeting in that:',
    options: [
      'It simply adds a percentage increase to last year\'s budget',
      'It is only used for government organizations',
      'It starts from a zero base — every expense must be justified for each new period, regardless of prior budgets',
      'It eliminates all discretionary spending',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'ZBB requires managers to justify every dollar from scratch each period, as if building the budget from zero. Decision packages rank activities by priority and cost-benefit. Benefits: eliminates budget slack and unnecessary spending, forces critical evaluation. Drawbacks: extremely time-consuming, may cause political conflicts, difficult to implement annually. Many organizations use ZBB periodically (every 3-5 years) rather than annually, or apply it selectively to specific departments.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Beyond Budgeting (developed by the BBRT) critiques traditional budgets as outdated command-and-control tools. Key principles: (1) replace fixed annual targets with relative/competitive benchmarks, (2) use rolling forecasts (continuously updated 12-18 months), (3) decentralize authority to front-line teams, (4) allocate resources dynamically rather than through budget negotiations, (5) use peer-based performance evaluation. Companies like Handelsbanken and Statoil have successfully adopted this model.',

PI is useful for capital rationing — when funds are limited, rank projects by PI to maximize total NPV per dollar invested.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Kaizen costing focuses on continuous, incremental cost reduction during manufacturing. Unlike standard costing (which sets a fixed standard and measures variance), kaizen sets progressively tighter cost reduction targets each period. Target costing occurs during product design/development; kaizen costing occurs during production. Key difference: standard costing asks "How much should it cost?" while kaizen asks "How much less can it cost this period?"

    explanation: 'ASC 820 fair value hierarchy: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets/liabilities (most reliable; e.g., NYSE stock prices), Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 (quoted prices for similar assets, interest rates, yield curves, credit spreads), Level 3 — Unobservable inputs based on entity\'s own assumptions (least reliable; discounted cash flow models, management estimates). The hierarchy prioritizes market-based data over entity-specific data.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Benchmarking types: (1) Internal — comparing similar processes within the organization, (2) Competitive — comparing against direct competitors, (3) Functional — comparing similar functions across different industries, (4) Generic/Best-in-class — comparing processes with the best performers regardless of industry. Benchmarking steps: plan, collect data, analyze gaps, implement improvements, monitor results. It drives continuous improvement by identifying performance gaps and learning from superior performers.',

    question: 'A company expects to sell 10,000 units. Beginning finished goods inventory is 1,500 units and desired ending inventory is 2,000 units. How many units must be produced?',
    options: [

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Production budget: Units to produce = Budgeted sales + Desired ending FG inventory − Beginning FG inventory = 10,000 + 2,000 − 1,500 = 10,500 units. This ensures enough inventory to meet sales demand while achieving the target ending inventory level. The production budget drives the direct materials purchases budget, direct labor budget, and manufacturing overhead budget.',

    explanation: 'Labor Rate Variance = (Actual Rate − Standard Rate) × Actual Hours = ($21 − $20) × 2,100 = $2,100 Unfavorable (paid more than standard). Labor Efficiency Variance = (Actual Hours − Standard Hours) × Standard Rate = (2,100 − 2,000) × $20 = $2,000 Unfavorable (used more hours than standard). Rate variances may be caused by wage increases, different skill-level workers, or overtime premiums. Efficiency variances may result from poor training, machine breakdowns, or material quality issues.',

    explanation: 'Fixed OH Volume Variance = Budgeted Fixed OH − Applied Fixed OH = Budgeted Fixed OH − (Standard rate × Standard hours allowed for actual output). Favorable when actual production exceeds the planned denominator volume (overhead is "over-applied"). This variance reflects capacity utilization, not spending efficiency. Fixed OH Spending Variance = Actual Fixed OH − Budgeted Fixed OH — reflects actual spending differences. Four-way OH analysis: Variable spending, Variable efficiency, Fixed spending, Fixed volume.',
