    question: 'When the selling division operates at full capacity with an external market, the minimum transfer price should be:',
    options: [
      'Full absorption cost',
      'Variable cost only',
      'Any price the buying division will accept',
      'Variable cost + opportunity cost (contribution margin lost on foregone external sales)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'General transfer pricing rule: Minimum transfer price = Variable cost + Opportunity cost. At full capacity, selling internally means giving up an external sale. Opportunity cost = contribution margin on the foregone external sale (external price − variable cost). So minimum price = variable cost + (external price − variable cost) = external market price. This ensures the selling division is at least as well off transferring internally as selling externally.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'International transfer pricing allows MNCs to shift profits by setting artificially high or low transfer prices. Example: selling at a low price from a high-tax country to a low-tax country subsidiary shifts profit to the low-tax jurisdiction. Tax authorities combat this with: (1) IRC §482 (US) — arm\'s length standard, (2) OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines, (3) Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) method, (4) Advance Pricing Agreements (APAs). Penalties for non-compliance can be severe. BEPS (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) is a major international initiative.',

Target profit formula: Units = (Fixed Costs + Target Profit) / CM per unit. For after-tax target: Units = (FC + Target Profit / (1 − Tax Rate)) / CM per unit.

This means sales can drop by 30% before the company starts losing money. The MOS measures the cushion above breakeven. A higher MOS indicates lower business risk. Operating leverage and MOS are inversely related — high fixed costs create high operating leverage but low margin of safety.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) = Contribution Margin / Operating Income. High fixed costs → high CM ratio → high DOL. A DOL of 4 means a 10% increase in sales produces a 40% increase in operating income — but a 10% sales decline causes a 40% income decrease. High operating leverage magnifies both gains and losses.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Variable costing: only variable manufacturing costs (DM, DL, variable MOH) are product costs. Fixed MOH is a period expense. Absorption costing: all manufacturing costs (DM, DL, variable MOH, fixed MOH) are product costs. Impact on income: when production > sales, absorption income > variable income (fixed MOH deferred in inventory). When production < sales, absorption income < variable income (previously deferred fixed MOH released). Variable costing is better for internal decision-making; absorption is required by GAAP.',

      'The same',
      '$40,000 lower',
      '$40,000 higher',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Income difference = Change in inventory × Fixed MOH per unit. Fixed MOH/unit = $200,000 / 10,000 = $20/unit. Inventory increase = 10,000 produced − 8,000 sold = 2,000 units. Income difference = 2,000 × $20 = $40,000. Absorption income is $40,000 higher because $40,000 of fixed MOH is "hidden" in ending inventory rather than expensed. This can incentivize overproduction under absorption costing, a well-known weakness managers should be aware of.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Normal spoilage is expected and unavoidable — it is a cost of doing business. Treatment: allocated to good units produced (product cost). Abnormal spoilage is unexpected and avoidable — treated as a period expense (loss) on the income statement, not inventoriable. In job costing: normal spoilage specific to a job → charged to that job. Normal spoilage common to all jobs → charged to manufacturing overhead. Separating normal from abnormal spoilage is important for cost management and process improvement.',

    explanation: 'Contingent consideration (earn-outs, milestone payments) is recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. It is classified as a liability or equity based on ASC 480/ASC 815 analysis. If classified as a liability: remeasured to fair value each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings (not goodwill). If classified as equity: not remeasured — settled within equity when resolved. Common example: additional payment if subsidiary achieves revenue targets within 2 years.',

      'The entity that created it',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'VIE consolidation model (ASC 810-10-25) applies when equity investors lack: (1) sufficient equity at risk, (2) decision-making rights, or (3) obligation to absorb losses/right to receive returns. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE — must have BOTH: (a) power to direct activities that most significantly impact economic performance, AND (b) variable interests that could be significant. Reassessment of VIE status and primary beneficiary occurs continuously. VIEs are common in structured finance, special purpose entities, and certain lease arrangements.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'ASC 205-20 (updated by ASU 2014-08) narrowed the definition. A discontinued operation must be: (1) a component that is disposed of or classified as held for sale, AND (2) the disposal represents a strategic shift with a major effect (e.g., disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment). Presentation: results of discontinued operations are shown separately, net of tax, below continuing operations. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are separately presented on the balance sheet.',

Examples: settlement of litigation related to pre-existing events, bankruptcy of a customer confirming uncollectibility. Type 2 (Non-recognized) — relates to conditions arising after the balance sheet date. Financial statements are NOT adjusted, but disclosure may be required. Examples: fire destroying a plant, business combination, stock issuance. Evaluation period extends through the date financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'In Y = a + bX: "a" = the y-intercept (fixed cost component), "b" = the slope (variable cost per unit of the cost driver X). R² (coefficient of determination) measures goodness of fit: R² of 0.85 means 85% of cost variation is explained by the activity level. Higher R² = better fit. Standard error measures the accuracy of the prediction. Multiple regression extends this to multiple independent variables: Y = a + b₁X₁ + b₂X₂. Regression is more reliable than the high-low method because it uses all available data.',
