    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Triple Bottom Line (TBL or 3BL): evaluates organizational success on three pillars — (1) Profit/Economic: traditional financial performance, (2) People/Social: impact on employees, communities, human rights, labor practices, (3) Planet/Environmental: carbon footprint, resource consumption, waste, biodiversity. TBL aligns with ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria used by investors.

      'It is prepared only once every five years',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Rolling forecasts maintain a constant horizon (e.g., always looking 12-18 months ahead). As Q1 actuals are reported, a new quarter is added at the end. Benefits: (1) always forward-looking (no stale budget), (2) more responsive to change, (3) reduces gaming/budget sandbagging, (4) less time-consuming than full annual budget redo. Best practices: focus on key drivers, use ranges rather than point estimates, update monthly or quarterly, limit detail to what drives decisions. Works well with Beyond Budgeting philosophy.',

Advantages: simple, ensures cost coverage, easy to justify. Disadvantages: ignores demand and competition, may overprice or underprice. Alternatives: (1) Target pricing — market-driven price, (2) Penetration pricing — low initial price for market share, (3) Skimming — high initial price for early adopters, (4) Value-based pricing — based on perceived customer value.',

Key insight: most cost reduction opportunities exist during the design phase, not production. Combining lifecycle costing with target costing maximizes cost management effectiveness.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Backflush costing delays journal entry recording until a trigger point (completion, sale). When triggered, costs are "flushed back" through the accounts. Works well in JIT environments because: (1) minimal WIP (so little inventory to track), (2) short production cycle times, (3) tracking every stage adds cost but little value. Trigger points vary: one-trigger (at sale), two-trigger (at completion and sale), three-trigger (at purchase, completion, sale). Not GAAP-compliant in all situations — appropriate only when inventory levels are minimal and consistent.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Lean accounting complements lean manufacturing: (1) organizes by value streams (product families) not departments, (2) uses simple box scores (operational, capacity, financial metrics), (3) replaces standard cost variances with actual costs and trend analysis, (4) values inventory at material cost only (no OH allocation), (5) measures cell-level performance (units/person, first-pass quality, on-time delivery).

      'How much profit each asset generates',

      'How efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue (Revenue / Average Total Assets)',
      'How quickly inventory is sold',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Total Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Total Assets. It measures the efficiency of asset utilization. A higher ratio indicates more revenue generated per dollar of assets. Industry context is critical: asset-light businesses (consulting, technology) have high turnover; asset-heavy businesses (utilities, airlines) have lower turnover. Fixed Asset Turnover = Revenue / Average Net Fixed Assets — measures efficiency of property, plant, and equipment usage specifically.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'IMA\'s four ethical standards: (1) Competence — maintain professional expertise, perform duties in accordance with laws and regulations, provide accurate information, (2) Confidentiality — do not disclose confidential information except when authorized or legally required, (3) Integrity — mitigate conflicts of interest, refrain from conduct that would prejudice ethical responsibilities, refrain from activities that discredit the profession, (4) Credibility — communicate information fairly and objectively, disclose all relevant information. For ethical dilemmas, IMA prescribes a resolution process: discuss with supervisor, then higher management, then ethics counseling.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Sales mix variance isolates the effect of selling a different product mix. Formula: For each product, (Actual mix % − Budgeted mix %) × Actual total units × Budgeted CM per unit, summed across products. Favorable when the mix shifts toward higher-margin products. Sales quantity variance: (Actual total units − Budgeted total units) × Budgeted mix % × Budgeted CM. Market size and market share variances provide further decomposition of the quantity variance for competitive analysis.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Weighted-average method averages all costs: Cost per EU = (Beginning WIP cost + Current period cost) / Total equivalent units. Total EU = Units completed and transferred out + Ending WIP equivalent units. Unlike FIFO, weighted-average does NOT distinguish between work done in prior periods and work done in the current period. This simplifies calculations but reduces accuracy for performance evaluation. FIFO isolates current period costs for better cost control.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 360 impairment test for assets held for use — two-step process: (1) Recoverability test: if carrying value > sum of undiscounted future cash flows → impairment exists, (2) Measurement: impairment loss = carrying value − fair value. The asset is written down to fair value, and the loss is reported in income. Important: the recoverability test uses undiscounted cash flows (a generous threshold), but the loss is measured using fair value. Assets held for sale: measured at lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. No depreciation while classified as held for sale.',
