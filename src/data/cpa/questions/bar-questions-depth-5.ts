    question: 'A company sells a product for $50 per unit with variable costs of $30 per unit and fixed costs of $200,000. What is the breakeven point in units?',
    options: [
      '4,000 units',
      '10,000 units',
      '6,667 units',
      '8,000 units',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Breakeven point in units = Fixed Costs ÷ Contribution Margin per unit. Contribution margin per unit = Selling price − Variable cost = $50 − $30 = $20. Breakeven = $200,000 ÷ $20 = 10,000 units. At 10,000 units: Revenue = $500,000, Variable costs = $300,000, Contribution margin = $200,000, which exactly covers the $200,000 fixed costs, yielding zero profit. Sales above 10,000 units generate profit equal to the contribution margin per unit ($20) for each additional unit sold.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The contribution margin (CM) ratio = Contribution Margin ÷ Revenue = (Revenue − Variable Costs) ÷ Revenue. Per unit: CM ratio = (Selling price − Variable cost) ÷ Selling price. The CM ratio indicates the proportion of each sales dollar available to cover fixed costs and generate profit. A higher CM ratio means a larger share of each revenue dollar contributes to covering fixed costs. The CM ratio is used to calculate breakeven in sales dollars: Breakeven in $ = Fixed Costs ÷ CM ratio.',

    explanation: 'Units for target profit = (Fixed Costs + Target Profit) ÷ Contribution Margin per unit. CM per unit = $100 − $60 = $40. Units = ($400,000 + $200,000) ÷ $40 = $600,000 ÷ $40 = 15,000 units. Verification: Revenue = 15,000 × $100 = $1,500,000. Variable costs = 15,000 × $60 = $900,000. Contribution margin = $600,000. Less fixed costs of $400,000 = $200,000 profit. For after-tax target profit, add back taxes: Required pre-tax profit = After-tax target ÷ (1 − tax rate).',

    explanation: 'Direct labor rate variance = (Actual Rate − Standard Rate) × Actual Hours = ($27 − $25) × 1,000 = $2,000 Unfavorable. The variance is unfavorable because the actual rate ($27) exceeded the standard rate ($25), meaning the company paid more per hour than budgeted. The labor rate variance is typically the responsibility of the HR or operations department. Causes include: overtime premiums, use of higher-paid workers, wage increases, or using differently skilled labor than planned.',

    question: 'A project requires an initial investment of $100,000 and is expected to generate equal annual cash flows of $30,000 for 5 years. If the cost of capital is 10%, which statement about NPV is correct?',
    options: [
      'The NPV is positive because total cash flows ($150,000) exceed the investment',
      'The NPV = $30,000 × PV annuity factor (10%, 5 years) − $100,000 ≈ $30,000 × 3.7908 − $100,000 = $13,724 (positive, so accept the project)',
      'The NPV is exactly zero',
      'The NPV is negative because of discounting',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'NPV = Present Value of future cash flows − Initial investment. For an annuity: PV = Annual cash flow × PV annuity factor. PV annuity factor (10%, 5 years) = 3.7908. PV of cash flows = $30,000 × 3.7908 = $113,724. NPV = $113,724 − $100,000 = $13,724 (positive). A positive NPV indicates the project earns more than the required rate of return (10%) and should be accepted. The NPV method is generally considered the best capital budgeting technique because it directly measures the expected increase in shareholder wealth.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The IRR is the discount rate that makes NPV = 0 — the rate at which the present value of all future cash inflows equals the initial investment outflow. Decision rule: accept the project if IRR > cost of capital (hurdle rate). IRR is typically found through trial and error or financial calculator/spreadsheet. Limitations of IRR include: (1) multiple IRRs possible when cash flows change signs multiple times, (2) it may rank mutually exclusive projects differently than NPV (scale and timing differences), (3) it assumes reinvestment at the IRR rate. When NPV and IRR conflict, NPV is preferred.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The current ratio = Current Assets ÷ Current Liabilities. It measures a company\'s ability to pay short-term obligations using short-term assets. A ratio above 1.0 indicates the company has more current assets than current liabilities. Generally, a current ratio between 1.5 and 2.0 is considered healthy, though it varies by industry. The current ratio includes all current assets (cash, receivables, inventory, prepaids), unlike the quick ratio which excludes inventory and prepaids.',

      'Accounts receivable',
      'Short-term investments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The quick ratio = (Cash + Short-term investments + Accounts receivable) ÷ Current liabilities. It excludes inventory and prepaid expenses because they are less liquid and may not be quickly convertible to cash. The quick ratio provides a more conservative measure of liquidity than the current ratio. A quick ratio of 1.0 or above generally indicates adequate short-term liquidity. Industries with fast-turning inventory (e.g., grocery) may operate with lower quick ratios.',

      '0.60',
      '1.50',
      '0.40',
      '2.50',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Debt-to-equity ratio = Total Liabilities ÷ Total Equity = $600,000 ÷ $400,000 = 1.50 (or 150%). This means the company uses $1.50 of debt for every $1.00 of equity. Higher ratios indicate greater financial leverage and potentially higher financial risk. Creditors prefer lower ratios (less risk), while shareholders may benefit from higher ratios due to the tax deductibility of interest and the potential for leveraged returns. Industry norms should be considered when evaluating this ratio — capital-intensive industries typically have higher leverage.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Job order costing accumulates costs by individual job, batch, or contract. It is used when products are distinguishable and can be identified separately (e.g., custom manufacturing, construction, law firms, advertising agencies). Direct materials, direct labor, and applied overhead are traced to each specific job using job cost sheets. Process costing, by contrast, is used for homogeneous products produced in a continuous flow (e.g., oil refining, chemical production, food processing), where costs are accumulated by department or process and averaged over all units.',

    explanation: 'Under the weighted-average method, equivalent units = Units completed and transferred out + Ending WIP × % complete. This method blends costs from prior periods (beginning WIP) with current period costs and does not distinguish between work done in prior periods versus the current period. The FIFO method, by contrast, separates prior period work: EU = (Beginning WIP × % needed to complete) + Units started and completed + (Ending WIP × % complete).

Advantages: simple, emphasizes liquidity. Disadvantages: (1) ignores the time value of money, (2) ignores cash flows after the payback period, (3) does not measure profitability. The discounted payback period addresses the TVM issue by using discounted cash flows. Despite its limitations, the payback period is widely used as a supplementary measure alongside NPV and IRR.',

    explanation: 'The fixed overhead volume variance = (Actual output × Standard hours per unit × SFOR) − Budgeted fixed overhead, or equivalently: (Standard hours allowed − Denominator hours) × SFOR. It measures the over- or under-application of fixed overhead due to actual production differing from the level assumed when setting the predetermined rate.

    question: 'Degree of operating leverage (DOL) at a given sales level is:',
    options: [
      'Fixed costs divided by variable costs',
      'Contribution margin divided by operating income — it measures how sensitive operating income is to changes in sales volume',
      'Net income divided by sales',
      'Total debt divided by total equity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'DOL = Contribution Margin ÷ Operating Income = (Sales − Variable Costs) ÷ (Sales − Variable Costs − Fixed Costs). DOL measures the sensitivity of operating income to changes in revenue. A DOL of 3 means a 10% increase in sales produces a 30% increase in operating income (and vice versa). Higher DOL indicates higher operating risk because a larger proportion of costs are fixed. Companies with high fixed costs (capital-intensive industries) have high DOL. DOL is highest near breakeven and decreases as sales increase above breakeven.',

    question: 'The profitability index (PI) is calculated as:',
    options: [
      'Net income divided by initial investment',
      'Present value of future cash flows divided by initial investment',
      'Total cash inflows divided by total cash outflows (undiscounted)',
      'IRR divided by cost of capital',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Profitability Index (PI) = PV of future cash flows ÷ Initial investment. Alternatively, PI = 1 + (NPV ÷ Initial investment). Decision rule: accept if PI > 1.0 (which is equivalent to NPV > 0). PI is particularly useful for ranking projects when capital is rationed — the project with the highest PI should be selected because it provides the highest PV per dollar invested. A PI of 1.15 means $1.15 of present value is created for every $1.00 invested.',

    question: 'In a make-or-buy decision, which of the following costs is IRRELEVANT?',
    options: [
      'Variable manufacturing costs of making the part',
      'Sunk costs, such as depreciation on existing equipment that has no salvage value and will be retained regardless of the decision',
      'The purchase price from the external supplier',
      'Avoidable fixed costs if the part is purchased externally',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered, regardless of which alternative is chosen. Depreciation on existing equipment with no salvage value and no alternative use is a sunk cost — it continues whether the company makes or buys the part. Relevant costs for decision-making must be: (1) future costs (not already incurred), and (2) different between alternatives. Relevant costs include: avoidable variable manufacturing costs, avoidable fixed costs, opportunity costs (e.g., revenue from using freed-up capacity), and the external purchase price. Sunk costs should never influence decisions.',

    options: [

      'Revenue divided by total debt',
      'Cash flow from operations divided by total liabilities',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Times interest earned = EBIT ÷ Interest expense. It measures a company\'s ability to meet its interest obligations from operating earnings. A TIE of 5.0 means earnings are 5 times the interest expense. Higher ratios indicate greater capacity to service debt. Generally, a TIE ratio above 3.0 is considered adequate, though this varies by industry. If TIE < 1.0, the company is not generating enough operating income to cover its interest expense. EBIT is used (not net income) because interest is paid before taxes — using pre-tax earnings reflects the actual funds available for interest payment.',

    question: 'A rolling (continuous) budget:',
    options: [
      'Is prepared only at the beginning of the year and never updated',
      'Continuously adds a new period (month or quarter) as the most recent period expires, maintaining a constant planning horizon',
      'Uses the same budget for all periods',
      'Is prepared only for capital expenditures',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A rolling (continuous) budget constantly extends the budget horizon by adding a new period (typically a month or quarter) as the most recent period ends. For example, when January expires, a new January (next year) is added. This maintains a constant 12-month (or other) planning horizon at all times. Advantages: (1) always has a full planning period ahead, (2) forces regular reassessment of assumptions, (3) reduces the "budget game" of end-of-year spending. Disadvantages: requires more time and effort than a static annual budget.',
