    question: 'A company has days inventory outstanding (DIO) of 45 days, days sales outstanding (DSO) of 30 days, and days payable outstanding (DPO) of 25 days. The cash conversion cycle (CCC) is:',
    options: [
      '100 days',
      '50 days',
      '40 days',
      '20 days',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Cash conversion cycle = DIO + DSO − DPO = 45 + 30 − 25 = 50 days. The CCC measures the time (in days) between paying suppliers for raw materials and collecting cash from customers. A shorter CCC means the company converts its investments in inventory and receivables into cash more quickly. Strategies to reduce CCC: (1) reduce DIO by improving inventory management, (2) reduce DSO by accelerating collections, (3) increase DPO by negotiating longer payment terms with suppliers. A negative CCC (rare) means the company collects from customers before paying suppliers (e.g., some retailers).',

      'Total inventory costs, which include carrying (holding) costs and ordering costs',
      'Production lead time',
      'Only the ordering cost per order',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'EOQ = √(2DS ÷ H), where D = Annual demand, S = Cost per order, H = Holding cost per unit per year. At EOQ, total ordering costs equal total carrying costs — this is the minimum total cost point. As order quantity increases: ordering costs decrease (fewer orders needed) but carrying costs increase (more average inventory). EOQ balances these opposing cost drivers. Assumptions: constant demand rate, constant lead time, no quantity discounts, instantaneous replenishment. If any assumption is significantly violated (seasonal demand, quantity discounts), the basic EOQ model must be modified.',

      '0.67 times',
      '1.5 times',
      '3.0 times',
      '2.0 times',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Total asset turnover = Net sales ÷ Average total assets = $3,000,000 ÷ $2,000,000 = 1.5 times. This means the company generates $1.50 in revenue for every $1.00 of assets. Higher asset turnover indicates more efficient use of assets to generate revenue. The ratio varies significantly by industry — capital-intensive industries (utilities, manufacturing) typically have lower asset turnover, while service or retail businesses often have higher turnover. This is a key component of the DuPont model: ROA = Profit margin × Asset turnover.',

      'Treat by-products the same as joint products',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'By-products have relatively minor sales value compared to main products. Two common methods: (1) Net realizable value (NRV) of by-products is deducted from the cost of the main product(s) at the time of production — reduces COGS; (2) By-product revenue is recognized as Other Revenue (or miscellaneous income) when sold. Under both methods, no joint costs are allocated to by-products — they are insignificant. By-products differ from joint products in that joint products have significant sales value and are the intended outputs of the process. Scrap is similar to by-products but has even lower value.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Segment margin = Segment revenue − Segment variable costs − Traceable fixed costs. Traceable fixed costs are those that would be eliminated if the segment is discontinued. Common (indirect) fixed costs are NOT deducted because they would continue regardless and are not controllable by segment managers. The segment margin is the best measure of long-run segment profitability and is used for keep-or-drop decisions. A segment should generally be kept if its segment margin is positive (even if it shows a loss after allocation of common costs). Allocating common costs to segments distorts performance evaluation.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Sensitivity analysis systematically tests how changes in individual input variables (sales volume, selling price, variable costs, discount rate, project life) affect the project\'s NPV or IRR. Each variable is changed independently ("what-if" analysis) while others remain at their base-case values. Variables to which NPV is most sensitive are the key risk factors deserving management attention. Advantages: identifies critical assumptions and key risk drivers. Limitations: (1) changes only one variable at a time (variables may be correlated), (2) does not provide probabilities. Scenario analysis (changing multiple variables simultaneously) and Monte Carlo simulation address these limitations.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Perfect competition characteristics: (1) many buyers and sellers, (2) homogeneous (identical) products, (3) no barriers to entry or exit, (4) perfect information, (5) no single firm can influence the market price. Because products are identical and there are many competitors, each firm must accept the market-determined price. The firm\'s demand curve is perfectly elastic (horizontal) at the market price. In the long run, perfectly competitive firms earn zero economic profit — any above-normal profits attract new entrants until prices fall. This contrasts with monopoly (one seller, price-maker) and monopolistic competition (differentiated products).',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ZBB starts from a "zero base" — every expenditure must be justified anew each period, regardless of whether it was included in the prior budget. Each manager ranks decision packages by priority for resources. Advantages: (1) eliminates budgetary slack and "incremental creep," (2) aligns spending with current priorities, (3) identifies low-value activities. Disadvantages: (1) very time-consuming and resource-intensive, (2) may be impractical for large organizations to do completely, (3) can create organizational resistance. Traditional (incremental) budgeting starts from the prior period and adjusts, which is simpler but may perpetuate inefficiencies.',

POHR is calculated at the beginning of the period using estimates because actual overhead is not known until the end. Applied overhead = POHR × Actual allocation base. Over-applied overhead (actual < applied) means too much overhead was charged to products; under-applied overhead (actual > applied) means not enough was charged.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Beta measures systematic (non-diversifiable, market) risk. Beta = 1.0: same volatility as the market. Beta > 1.0: more volatile than the market. Beta < 1.0 (but positive): less volatile than the market. Beta = 0: no correlation with the market (e.g., risk-free asset). Negative beta: moves opposite to the market (rare). A beta of 0.8 means the stock should move approximately 80% as much as the market in the same direction. Portfolio beta = weighted average of individual betas. Systematic risk cannot be diversified away — it is caused by market-wide factors (interest rates, recession, inflation). Unsystematic risk can be diversified away.',

    explanation: 'In multi-product CVP analysis, calculate the weighted-average contribution margin based on the sales mix. With a 3:1 ratio, 75% of units are Product A and 25% are Product B. Weighted-average CM = (3/4 × $10) + (1/4 × $14) = $7.50 + $3.50 = $11.00 per unit. Breakeven in total units = Fixed costs ÷ Weighted-average CM = $270,000 ÷ $11 = 24,545 units. At breakeven: Product A = 75% × 24,545 = 18,409 units; Product B = 25% × 24,545 = 6,136 units. Total CM = (18,409 × $10) + (6,136 × $14) = $184,090 + $85,904 = $270,000, which covers fixed costs exactly.',

      '12%',
      '36.7%',
      '24%',
      '2%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Cost of not taking discount = [Discount % ÷ (100% − Discount %)] × [365 ÷ (Full payment period − Discount period)]. = [2% ÷ 98%] × [365 ÷ (30 − 10)] = 0.020408 × 18.25 = 0.3724 or approximately 36.7%. This means a buyer who forgoes the 2% discount to pay on day 30 (instead of day 10) is effectively borrowing at an annualized rate of about 36.7%. This is extremely expensive compared to typical borrowing rates, so the discount should almost always be taken if cash or bank borrowing is available at a lower rate.',

      'Allocates costs only to production departments using direct labor hours',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The step-down method allocates service department costs one at a time in a specified order (typically starting with the department that provides the most service to other service departments). Once a department\'s costs are fully allocated, it receives no cost back from subsequent allocations. This partially recognizes interdepartmental services (unlike the direct method, which ignores all inter-service relationships). The reciprocal (algebraic/simultaneous equations) method fully accounts for mutual services between all service departments and is the most theoretically accurate but most complex. The direct method is simplest but ignores inter-service relationships entirely.',

Key concepts: (1) "market value" — measured at current prices, (2) "final" — excludes intermediate goods to avoid double-counting, (3) "domestic" — produced within the country\'s borders regardless of producer nationality (GNP, by contrast, counts output by nationals regardless of location).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Traditional IRR implicitly assumes reinvestment of intermediate cash flows at the IRR, which may be unrealistically high (or low). MIRR corrects this by: (1) compounding all positive cash flows forward to the terminal year at the firm\'s cost of capital (a more realistic reinvestment rate), (2) discounting all negative cash flows back to time zero at the financing cost, and (3) finding the rate that equates the PV of costs to the future value of benefits. MIRR always yields a unique answer (unlike IRR, which may give multiple rates when cash flows change signs multiple times). MIRR is more conservative and realistic than IRR.',

    explanation: 'Operating cash flow ratio = Cash flow from operations ÷ Current liabilities. It measures a company\'s ability to cover its current obligations using cash generated from normal business operations. Unlike the current ratio, which uses balance sheet amounts (point-in-time), the operating cash flow ratio uses actual cash generated over a period — arguably a more reliable measure of liquidity. A ratio above 1.0 means operating cash flows could cover current liabilities entirely. This ratio is less susceptible to manipulation because cash flow from operations is harder to artificially inflate than accrual-based measures.',

    explanation: 'An 80% learning curve means that each time cumulative output doubles, the cumulative average time (or cost) per unit drops to 80% of its previous level. Example: If the first unit takes 100 hours, then the cumulative average for 2 units = 80 hours (total = 160). Cumulative average for 4 units = 64 hours (total = 256). Cumulative average for 8 units = 51.2 hours (total = 409.6). The learning curve is most applicable to labor-intensive operations and early production stages.

It is ideal when: (1) a competitive, active external market exists, (2) the product is comparable to external alternatives, (3) divisions operate as independent profit centers. Advantages: (1) objective and verifiable, (2) promotes goal congruence — internal transfers mimic market transactions, (3) provides accurate profitability measurement for each division. The market price may be adjusted down for savings on internal transfers (e.g., no selling costs, no bad debts).

The real interest rate is the return after adjusting for inflation — it represents the increase in purchasing power. If the nominal rate is 7% and expected inflation is 3%, the real rate is approximately 4%. The Fisher effect implies that nominal interest rates adjust one-for-one with expected inflation, leaving real rates unchanged. Central banks influence nominal rates through monetary policy, but real rates are determined by supply and demand for loanable funds.',

    question: 'Backflush costing is most suitable for companies that:',
    options: [
      'Have large amounts of work-in-process inventory',
      'Use just-in-time (JIT) production with minimal inventories and short production cycles, allowing journal entries to be simplified',
      'Use job order costing for custom products',
      'Have significant overhead allocation differences',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Backflush costing delays recording some or all journal entries related to inventory until later in the production process (typically at completion or sale). It is designed for JIT environments where: (1) inventory levels are negligible, (2) production cycle time is very short, (3) the difference between traditional sequential costing and backflush costing is immaterial. Benefits: reduces accounting entries and bookkeeping effort. Risks: (1) may not comply with GAAP if WIP inventory is significant, (2) reduces cost visibility during production, (3) may complicate variance analysis. It essentially bypasses WIP and sometimes even raw materials accounts.',

      '(Net income − Preferred dividends) divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding',
      'Net income divided by total equity',
      'Operating income divided by shares outstanding at year-end',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Basic EPS = (Net income − Preferred dividends) ÷ Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Preferred dividends are subtracted because they represent a claim on earnings that is not available to common shareholders. Declared dividends are subtracted for noncumulative preferred stock; for cumulative preferred, the annual dividend is subtracted whether or not declared. Weighted-average shares accounts for shares issued or repurchased during the year. Diluted EPS additionally considers the potential dilutive effect of stock options, convertible debt, convertible preferred stock, and warrants using the treasury stock method or if-converted method.',

    question: 'A revolving credit agreement (revolver) differs from a line of credit in that:',
    options: [
      'It is always unsecured',
      'The bank is legally committed to lend up to the maximum amount for the term of the agreement, providing greater certainty of access to funds',
      'It cannot be used for working capital needs',
      'It has no associated fees',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A revolving credit agreement is a formal, legally binding commitment by a bank to lend up to a specified maximum amount for a set period. The borrower pays a commitment fee on the unused portion. A (non-committed) line of credit is an informal arrangement — the bank can withdraw it at any time without notice, providing less certainty. A revolver provides guaranteed access to funds but at a higher total cost (interest + commitment fee). Companies use revolvers as a reliable backstop for working capital fluctuations and as backup for commercial paper programs. Lines of credit are simpler and cheaper but riskier.',

    question: 'A company expects to sell 8,000 units. Beginning finished goods inventory is 1,500 units and desired ending inventory is 2,000 units. How many units must be produced?',
    options: [
      '7,500 units',
      '8,500 units',
      '10,000 units',
      '6,000 units',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Production budget: Units to produce = Budgeted sales + Desired ending inventory − Beginning inventory = 8,000 + 2,000 − 1,500 = 8,500 units. This formula ensures the company will have enough units to meet sales demand while building inventory to the desired ending level. The production budget flows into direct materials, direct labor, and overhead budgets. If ending inventory is desired to be higher than beginning inventory (as here, 2,000 vs. 1,500), production must exceed sales. The 500-unit inventory build-up requires producing 500 more units than planned sales.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'FCF = Cash flow from operations (CFO) − Capital expenditures (CapEx). FCF represents the cash available to the firm after maintaining and investing in its asset base. Uses of FCF include: paying dividends, repurchasing shares, paying down debt, or making acquisitions. Positive FCF indicates the company generates sufficient cash from its operations to fund its capital investments and have cash remaining. Negative FCF may indicate heavy investment for future growth (not necessarily bad). Free cash flow to equity (FCFE) further subtracts net debt payments. FCF yield = FCF ÷ Market capitalization.',
