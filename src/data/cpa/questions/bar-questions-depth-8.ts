    question: 'A division has operating income of $500,000, invested capital of $4,000,000, and a required rate of return of 10%. The residual income is:',
    options: [
      '$500,000',
      '$100,000',
      '$400,000',
      '$900,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Residual income (RI) = Operating income − (Invested capital × Required rate of return) = $500,000 − ($4,000,000 × 10%) = $500,000 − $400,000 = $100,000. A positive RI means the division earned more than the required minimum return on its invested capital. RI encourages goal congruence because managers are rewarded for investing in projects earning above the required rate, even if ROI declines. ROI, by contrast, may cause managers to reject profitable projects that would lower the division\'s ROI below its current level (even though the project earns above the cost of capital).',

    question: 'ROI (Return on Investment) for a division can be decomposed using the DuPont formula as:',
    options: [
      'Net income ÷ equity',
      'Margin (operating income ÷ sales) × Turnover (sales ÷ invested capital)',
      'Revenue growth × asset growth',
      'Operating income ÷ fixed assets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Divisional ROI = Operating income ÷ Invested capital = (Operating income ÷ Sales) × (Sales ÷ Invested capital) = Margin × Turnover. Margin measures profit efficiency (how much profit per dollar of sales). Turnover measures asset efficiency (how much revenue per dollar of invested capital). A division can improve ROI by: (1) increasing margin (reducing costs or raising prices), (2) increasing turnover (generating more revenue from the same asset base), or (3) both. ROI is widely used but has limitations: it can discourage managers from investing in projects that earn above the cost of capital but below the current ROI.',

    question: 'Economic Value Added (EVA) differs from residual income in that EVA:',
    options: [
      'Uses operating income without any adjustments',
      'Uses after-tax operating income (NOPAT) and makes adjustments to capital for items like R&D capitalization, goodwill amortization add-back, and operating lease capitalization to better reflect economic reality',
      'Ignores the cost of capital',
      'Uses book value of equity only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'EVA = NOPAT − (WACC × Invested capital), where NOPAT = Net Operating Profit After Tax. Key adjustments that differentiate EVA from simple residual income: (1) capitalize and amortize R&D instead of expensing, (2) add back goodwill amortization, (3) capitalize operating leases, (4) use beginning-of-period capital, (5) remove non-cash charges. These adjustments aim to convert accounting income into economic profit. Positive EVA indicates value creation; negative EVA indicates value destruction. Created by Stern Stewart & Co., EVA has become a widely used performance metric that aligns management behavior with shareholder wealth maximization.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Leading indicators are performance drivers that predict future outcomes (forward-looking). Examples: employee training hours, R&D spending, customer satisfaction scores, process cycle time improvements. Lagging indicators are outcome measures reflecting past results: revenue, profit, ROE, EPS, market share. The BSC links them causally: Investing in employee training (learning & growth) → Improves processes (internal process) → Increases customer satisfaction (customer) → Drives revenue and profit (financial). Effective BSC implementation requires both leading indicators (to guide action) and lagging indicators (to confirm results).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Line charts are ideal for showing trends over time because the x-axis represents time periods and the connecting lines make it easy to see upward, downward, or cyclical patterns. Appropriate chart selection: (1) Line chart — trends over time, (2) Bar chart — comparisons across categories, (3) Pie chart — composition/parts of a whole (limited to ~5-7 segments), (4) Scatter plot — relationship between two variables (detecting correlation), (5) Histogram — distribution of a single variable, (6) Heat map — patterns in large data sets. Poor visualization choices (e.g., pie charts for trends) distort the message and impede decision-making.',

      'Setting costs at the industry average',
      'Minimizing variable costs without regard to price',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Target costing is a market-driven approach: Target cost = Market price − Desired profit margin. Rather than setting the price based on cost (cost-plus pricing), target costing sets the cost based on the price the market will bear. If the current expected cost exceeds the target, the company must find ways to reduce costs through value engineering, design changes, process improvements, or supplier negotiations. Target costing is widely used in Japanese manufacturing (Toyota pioneered it) and is applied during the product design stage when ~80% of costs are committed. It encourages cross-functional collaboration (design, engineering, marketing, accounting).',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Kaizen costing (from Japanese "kaizen" = continuous improvement) seeks small, ongoing cost reductions during production. While target costing applies during product design (pre-production), kaizen costing applies during manufacturing (post-design). Key features: (1) involves all employees in suggesting improvements, (2) targets incremental reductions each period (not one-time changes), (3) focuses on process efficiency, waste elimination, and productivity gains, (4) sets cost reduction targets that become more challenging each period. Kaizen is part of the broader lean manufacturing philosophy, along with JIT, TQM, and kanban systems.',

    question: 'Scenario analysis in capital budgeting differs from sensitivity analysis in that scenario analysis:',

      'Changes only one variable at a time',

      'Uses only the base-case estimate',
      'Focuses exclusively on the discount rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Scenario analysis constructs complete alternative pictures of the future by changing multiple interrelated variables simultaneously. Typical scenarios: (1) Base case — most likely estimates, (2) Best case — optimistic estimates for all key variables, (3) Worst case — pessimistic estimates. This addresses a key limitation of sensitivity analysis (which changes only one variable at a time, ignoring correlations). The range of NPVs across scenarios indicates the project\'s risk. Managers can assess whether the worst case is acceptable and the probability-weighted expected NPV. Monte Carlo simulation extends this further by simultaneously varying many inputs using probability distributions.',

    question: 'Under the Theory of Constraints (TOC), throughput contribution is defined as:',
    options: [
      'Revenue minus all manufacturing costs',
      'Revenue minus totally variable costs (primarily direct materials) — only truly variable costs are deducted because all other costs are considered fixed in the short run',
      'Revenue minus fixed costs',
      'Gross margin minus operating expenses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'TOC/throughput accounting defines throughput = Revenue − Totally variable costs (usually just direct materials). Unlike traditional contribution margin (which deducts all variable costs including variable labor and overhead), TOC considers only direct materials as truly variable in the short run — labor and overhead are treated as fixed operating expenses because resources (workers, machines) are already committed. The goal is to maximize throughput per unit of the binding constraint (bottleneck). TOC focuses on: (1) identify the constraint, (2) exploit it (maximize throughput), (3) subordinate everything else, (4) elevate the constraint (increase capacity), (5) repeat.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Responsibility accounting assigns accountability based on what a manager controls. Hierarchy: (1) Cost center — manager controls costs only (e.g., production department). Evaluated on cost efficiency, budget adherence. (2) Revenue center — manager controls revenues only (e.g., sales territory). Evaluated on revenue generated vs. quota. (3) Profit center — manager controls both revenues and costs (e.g., product line, store). Evaluated on profit/margin. (4) Investment center — manager controls revenues, costs, and capital investment decisions (e.g., division). Evaluated on ROI, residual income, or EVA.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The correlation coefficient (r) ranges from −1 to +1. Values close to ±1 indicate strong linear relationships; values near 0 indicate weak or no linear relationship. However, correlation ≠ causation. Two variables may be correlated because: (1) X causes Y, (2) Y causes X, (3) a third variable (confounding variable) causes both, or (4) the relationship is coincidental. Establishing causation requires: controlled experiments, time-order (cause precedes effect), theory/logic supporting the relationship, ruling out confounders.

(2) Peak — maximum output, economy at full capacity, inflation concerns may arise. (3) Contraction (recession) — GDP declines for two or more consecutive quarters, unemployment rises, spending decreases. (4) Trough — lowest point, economy bottoms out before recovery begins. Leading economic indicators (stock prices, new orders, housing starts) predict cycle turning points. Lagging indicators (unemployment rate, CPI, bank loans) confirm trends already in progress.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Throughput costing (also called super-variable costing) treats only direct materials as product costs (inventoriable). All other costs — including direct labor and all overhead — are period costs expensed in the period incurred. Comparison of costing methods by inventoriable costs: (1) Absorption costing: DM + DL + Variable OH + Fixed OH, (2) Variable costing: DM + DL + Variable OH, (3) Throughput costing: DM only. Throughput costing eliminates the incentive to overproduce (since only materials go into inventory), aligning with TOC/JIT philosophies.

The factor assumes collection responsibility and credit risk (in non-recourse factoring) or the seller retains credit risk (in recourse factoring). Benefits: (1) immediate cash flow improvement, (2) reduced collection costs, (3) in non-recourse, transfers credit risk. Costs: the discount (factoring fee) and any holdback amount.

Fabricated data tends to have a more uniform distribution of leading digits. Auditors and forensic accountants compare actual digit frequencies in financial data (invoices, expenses, payments) against Benford\'s expected frequencies. Significant deviations may indicate: data manipulation, fraud, errors, or unusual transactions warranting further investigation. Benford\'s Law works best with large, naturally occurring data sets spanning multiple orders of magnitude.',

    question: 'Real options analysis in capital budgeting recognizes that:',
    options: [
      'All project parameters are fixed once the investment is made',
      'Managers have the flexibility to make future decisions (expand, abandon, delay, or modify projects) that can increase project value beyond the static NPV estimate',
      'Option pricing is only relevant for financial derivatives',
      'Projects should be evaluated only at inception',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Real options recognize that capital investment decisions are not "now or never" — managers have flexibility to adapt as uncertainty resolves. Types: (1) Option to expand — invest more if demand is high, (2) Option to abandon — exit if project performs poorly (salvage value = exercise price), (3) Option to delay — wait for more information before committing, (4) Option to switch — change inputs or outputs. Traditional NPV understates project value because it ignores these flexibilities. Real option value = Strategic NPV − Static NPV. Projects in highly uncertain environments benefit most from real options analysis. Valuation methods include decision trees and option pricing models (Black-Scholes).',

    question: 'If actual results show an unfavorable direct materials quantity variance and a favorable direct materials price variance, a likely explanation is:',
    options: [
      'The company bought and used exactly the standard amounts',
      'The company purchased lower-quality (cheaper) materials that resulted in more waste and higher usage — the pricing savings were offset by usage inefficiencies',
      'The company used less material than expected but at a higher price',
      'Both variances are unrelated',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A favorable price variance (bought cheaply) combined with an unfavorable quantity variance (used more than standard) is a classic pattern suggesting the purchasing department bought lower-quality materials at a lower price, which then caused production problems (more waste, rework, higher usage). This illustrates why variances should not be analyzed in isolation — they are often interrelated. The savings from cheaper materials may be more than offset by increased usage costs. This analysis also highlights the importance of assigning responsibility appropriately — the purchasing manager may have achieved a "good" price variance but at the expense of production efficiency.',

    question: 'An annuity due differs from an ordinary annuity in that payments for an annuity due occur:',
    options: [
      'At the end of each period',
      'At the beginning of each period, resulting in a higher present value and future value compared to an ordinary annuity of the same amount',

      'Only at the start and end of the term',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'An ordinary annuity has payments at the end of each period; an annuity due has payments at the beginning of each period. Because annuity due payments occur one period earlier, each payment earns interest for one additional period. Conversions: PV (annuity due) = PV (ordinary annuity) × (1 + r). FV (annuity due) = FV (ordinary annuity) × (1 + r). Examples of annuity due: rent payments (due at start of month), insurance premiums (due at start of coverage period), lottery payouts with immediate first payment. Examples of ordinary annuity: bond coupon payments, loan payments, salary payments (end of period).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Benchmarking types: (1) Internal — comparing divisions/units within the same organization, (2) Competitive — comparing against direct competitors, (3) Functional — comparing similar processes in different industries, (4) Generic (best practice) — comparing against best-in-class regardless of industry. Steps: identify what to benchmark → select benchmarking partners → gather data → analyze gaps → develop improvement plan → implement changes → monitor results. Benefits: identifies improvement opportunities, sets realistic performance targets, motivates change by demonstrating that better performance is achievable. Limitations: difficulty obtaining competitor data, differences in context may limit comparability.',

ERM is holistic (enterprise-wide, not siloed), proactive, integrated with strategy, and considers risk appetite — the amount and type of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of value. ERM does not aim to eliminate risk but to manage it within acceptable levels. Risk responses: accept, avoid, reduce, share/transfer.',
