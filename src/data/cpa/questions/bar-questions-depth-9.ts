    question: 'Under ASC 606, the five-step revenue recognition model is applied in the following order:',
    options: [
      'Determine price → Identify contract → Allocate → Identify obligations → Recognize',
      'Identify the contract → Identify performance obligations → Determine transaction price → Allocate transaction price → Recognize revenue when (or as) obligations are satisfied',
      'Recognize revenue → Measure consideration → Allocate to segments → Identify customer → Determine cost',
      'Identify customer → Negotiate terms → Record receivable → Recognize revenue → Collect cash',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) five steps: (1) Identify the contract with a customer (approved, identifiable rights, payment terms, commercial substance, probable collection), (2) Identify the performance obligations (distinct goods/services), (3) Determine the transaction price (consideration expected, including variable consideration, significant financing, noncash, payable to customer), (4) Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations (relative standalone selling prices), (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied (point in time or over time). This model applies to all contracts with customers regardless of industry.',

    question: 'Under ASC 606, a promised good or service is a separate performance obligation if it is:',
    options: [
      'Priced separately on the invoice',
      'Distinct — the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own (or with readily available resources) AND the promise is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract',
      'Delivered at a different time than other goods',
      'Required by the contract terms',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A performance obligation is distinct if it meets BOTH criteria: (1) Capable of being distinct — the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other readily available resources (sold separately by the entity or others), AND (2) Distinct within the context of the contract — the promise to transfer is separately identifiable from other promises (not highly interrelated, not significantly customized with other goods/services, not highly dependent/integrated). If not distinct, goods/services are combined into a single performance obligation. Examples of non-distinct: construction services that are highly interrelated, significant customization/integration.',

    question: 'When a contract includes variable consideration (such as a performance bonus), the entity should include the variable consideration in the transaction price:',
    options: [
      'Only when the maximum amount is received',
      'To the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will NOT occur when the uncertainty is resolved (the constraint)',
      'At the maximum possible amount',
      'Only at the end of the contract',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Variable consideration (discounts, rebates, refunds, incentives, penalties, bonuses) is estimated using either the expected value method (probability-weighted) or the most likely amount method, whichever better predicts the outcome. The constraint: include variable consideration only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will NOT occur. Factors increasing reversal risk: susceptibility to external factors, long resolution period, limited experience with similar contracts, broad range of possible amounts. The estimate is updated each reporting period. This prevents premature revenue recognition while still reflecting the entity\'s best estimate.',

    question: 'Under ASC 842, a lessee recognizes on its balance sheet for all leases (except short-term leases):',
    options: [
      'Only the minimum lease payments',
      'A right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability, regardless of whether the lease is classified as operating or finance',
      'Only finance lease assets',
      'No assets or liabilities for operating leases',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 842 requires ALL leases (except short-term leases of 12 months or less, by election) to be recognized on the balance sheet with: (1) Right-of-use (ROU) asset — representing the right to use the underlying asset, and (2) Lease liability — representing the obligation to make lease payments. This was a major change from ASC 840, which kept operating leases off the balance sheet. Finance leases vs. operating leases differ in income statement presentation (finance: amortization + interest; operating: single straight-line lease expense) and cash flow classification, but both are on the balance sheet.',

      'The present value of lease payments equals or exceeds substantially all (typically 90% or more) of the fair value of the underlying asset',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Finance lease criteria (any one triggers finance classification): (1) Transfers ownership by end of term, (2) Purchase option the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise, (3) Lease term is for the major part (~75%) of remaining economic life, (4) PV of payments ≥ substantially all (~90%) of fair value, (5) The asset is so specialized that it has no alternative use to the lessor. Option B describes a purchase option NOT reasonably certain to be exercised — that alone does NOT indicate a finance lease.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 805 (Business Combinations) — the acquisition method: (1) Identify the acquirer, (2) Determine the acquisition date, (3) Recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, (4) Recognize goodwill or a bargain purchase gain. Goodwill = Consideration paid + NCI fair value + Previously held equity interest fair value − Fair value of identifiable net assets acquired. If consideration < fair value of net assets, a bargain purchase gain is recognized in earnings. Acquisition costs (legal, advisory, due diligence) are expensed as incurred, not capitalized.

      'Amortizes goodwill over 10 years',
      'Tests for impairment only when there is a triggering event',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2017-04 simplified the goodwill impairment test to a one-step process. Compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount (including goodwill). If carrying amount > fair value, recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill (goodwill cannot go below zero). The old two-step method (computing implied fair value of goodwill) was eliminated. Testing is performed annually (at the same time each year) and whenever a triggering event or change in circumstances indicates the fair value may be below carrying amount. An optional qualitative assessment ("Step 0") may be performed first to determine if quantitative testing is necessary.',

    explanation: 'ASC 606 recognizes revenue over time if ANY ONE criterion is met: (1) Customer simultaneously receives and consumes benefits (e.g., cleaning services, routine processing), (2) Entity\'s performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls (e.g., construction on customer land), (3) Entity\'s performance does not create an asset with alternative use AND the entity has enforceable right to payment for performance to date (e.g., custom manufacturing with no alternative use). If none of these are met, revenue is recognized at a point in time (when control transfers).

    explanation: 'The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments not yet paid at the commencement date. Lease payments include: (1) fixed payments net of lease incentives, (2) variable payments based on an index or rate, (3) amounts for residual value guarantees probable to be owed, (4) exercise price of a purchase option if reasonably certain to be exercised, (5) payments for penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects exercise of that option. The discount rate is the rate implicit in the lease (if readily determinable) or the lessee\'s incremental borrowing rate.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Consolidation requires elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions because the consolidated group is presented as a single economic entity. Key eliminations: (1) Intercompany receivables/payables, (2) Intercompany revenue/expenses (sales between parent and subsidiary), (3) Intercompany profit in inventory (upstream and downstream), (4) Intercompany profit in fixed assets, (5) Intercompany dividends (subsidiary dividends to parent), (6) Investment in subsidiary account against subsidiary equity. For upstream sales (subsidiary to parent), unrealized profit elimination is allocated between the parent and noncontrolling interest.

The ineffective portion (if any) is recognized in earnings immediately. This matching of hedge gains/losses with the hedged item reduces earnings volatility. Examples: hedging forecasted purchases/sales in foreign currency, hedging variable-rate debt interest payments. Hedge effectiveness must be assessed at least quarterly.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Incremental costs of obtaining a contract (costs that would not have been incurred absent the contract, such as sales commissions) are capitalized as a contract asset if the entity expects to recover them. They are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which may extend beyond the specific contract if renewals are expected and the commission structure supports it. Practical expedient: if the amortization period would be one year or less, the entity may expense the costs as incurred. Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized if they: (1) relate directly to a contract, (2) generate/enhance resources used to satisfy performance obligations, and (3) are expected to be recovered.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 718 requires stock options granted to employees to be measured at fair value on the grant date (typically using Black-Scholes or a lattice model). This grant-date fair value is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period (vesting period), with a corresponding credit to additional paid-in capital (equity). The expense is not subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value of the options. If options are forfeited before vesting, previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.

The VA reduces the DTA to the amount expected to be realized. Sources of future taxable income considered: (1) future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, (2) future taxable income exclusive of reversing differences, (3) taxable income in carryback years (if carryback is permitted), (4) tax-planning strategies.

If a sale occurs: the seller-lessee derecognizes the asset, recognizes the transaction price per ASC 606, adjusts any off-market terms, recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability for the leaseback. If the transfer does NOT qualify as a sale (e.g., seller-lessee has repurchase option at a fixed price): the "sale" is instead accounted for as a financing arrangement — the asset stays on the seller-lessee\'s books, and cash received is recorded as a financial liability.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Fair value hedge accounting (ASC 815-25): Both the gain/loss on the hedging derivative AND the offsetting change in fair value of the hedged item (attributable to the hedged risk) are recognized in the same line item in earnings in the current period. The hedged item\'s carrying amount is adjusted for the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk (basis adjustment). This provides offset in earnings, reducing volatility that would occur if only the derivative were at fair value. Examples: hedging the fair value of fixed-rate debt (interest rate risk), hedging the fair value of inventory (price risk). If the hedge is perfectly effective, the gains/losses fully offset in earnings.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 820 valuation approaches: (1) Market approach — uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets/liabilities (market multiples, matrix pricing), (2) Income approach — converts future amounts (cash flows, earnings) to a single present value using discounting techniques (DCF, option pricing models), (3) Cost approach — reflects the amount currently required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost, less obsolescence). The entity selects the approach(es) most appropriate for the specific measurement, maximizing observable inputs. Multiple approaches may be used, and the results assessed.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Principal vs. agent determination hinges on control: Does the entity control the specified good or service before it is transferred to the customer? Indicators of principal status (control): (1) entity is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise, (2) entity has inventory risk before/after transfer or upon return, (3) entity has discretion in establishing the selling price. If principal: recognize revenue GROSS (full consideration as revenue, supplier\'s portion as cost). If agent: recognize revenue NET (only the fee/commission).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 805 provides a measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust provisional amounts as it obtains additional information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Adjustments during the measurement period are made retrospectively (as if known at the acquisition date) — prior period financial statements are revised if presented comparatively. After the measurement period closes (the earlier of when the acquirer receives the information sought or one year from acquisition), no further adjustments are made; subsequent changes are recognized in earnings.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A deferred tax liability (DTL) arises when an asset\'s book (financial reporting) basis exceeds its tax basis, creating a future taxable amount. Common example: accelerated depreciation for tax (MACRS) vs. straight-line for books. Year 1: Tax depreciation > Book depreciation → pays less tax now, but will pay more later when tax depreciation is lower. This creates a DTL. The reverse (tax basis > book basis for an asset) creates a deferred tax asset (DTA). For liabilities: book basis > tax basis = DTA (e.g., warranty accrual deductible when paid). DTAs and DTLs are measured using enacted tax rates expected when they reverse.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'RSUs are measured at grant-date fair value (typically the stock price on the grant date since RSUs have no exercise price). Compensation expense = Fair value per RSU × Number granted × (1 − estimated forfeiture rate) or with an initial assumption of full vesting and recognizing forfeitures as they occur (policy election). Expense is recognized straight-line over the requisite service (vesting) period. Upon vesting, shares are issued (often net of shares withheld for tax withholding). RSUs differ from stock options: no exercise price, value is always positive (unlike options that can be underwater), and they deliver shares (not options to buy shares).',
