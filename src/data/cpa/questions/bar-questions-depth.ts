ROI can also be decomposed using the DuPont formula: ROI = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover = (Operating Income / Revenue) × (Revenue / Average Assets).

A ratio > 1 indicates more current assets than current liabilities. Related ratios: Quick ratio (acid test) = (Cash + Short-term investments + Receivables) / Current liabilities — excludes inventory and prepaid expenses. Cash ratio = Cash / Current liabilities (most conservative).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Since ASC 810-10-45 (SFAS 160), NCI is presented: (1) Balance sheet — within equity, but separate from the parent\'s equity, (2) Income statement — net income attributable to NCI is presented as a deduction from consolidated net income to arrive at net income attributable to the parent. NCI is measured at fair value at the acquisition date (full goodwill method). Changes in ownership that do not result in loss of control are treated as equity transactions.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 740-10-25 (FIN 48) uses a two-step approach: (1) Recognition — recognize the tax position only if it is more likely than not (>50%) to be sustained based on technical merits, (2) Measurement — measure the benefit at the largest amount with greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) are disclosed in financial statements. Interest and penalties on UTBs are classified per entity policy (either income tax expense or other). Annual reconciliation of UTBs is required.',
