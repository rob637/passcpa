ROI can also be decomposed using the DuPont formula: ROI = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover = (Operating Income / Revenue) × (Revenue / Average Assets). Limitation: ROI may discourage managers from investing in projects with returns above the cost of capital but below the division\'s current ROI, leading to suboptimal decisions.',

    question: 'Eastern Corp. is considering expanding a division with additional invested capital of $3 million. The division currently earns NOPAT of $1.5 million on $10 million of invested capital. The expansion would increase NOPAT by $400,000. If WACC is 11%, should the expansion be approved based on incremental EVA?',
    options: [
      'Yes — incremental EVA is $70,000 (value-creating investment)',

The positive incremental EVA indicates the expansion creates shareholder value. The incremental return = $400K / $3M = 13.3%, which exceeds the 11% WACC.

With excess capacity and no external market, opportunity cost is $0, so minimum = variable cost. This ensures: (1) the company\'s overall profit is maximized, (2) the buying division is not charged for unused capacity costs, (3) optimal resource allocation.

    '8.0%',
    '10.0%',
    '6.5%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ROA = Net Income / Average Total Assets = $120,000 / $1,500,000 = 8.0%. ROA measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit. It is a key profitability ratio used in DuPont analysis, where ROA = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover.',

Key profitability ratios: (1) Gross margin — production efficiency, (2) Operating margin = Operating income / Revenue — core business profitability, (3) Net profit margin = Net income / Revenue — bottom-line profitability, (4) Return on equity = Net income / Average equity — shareholder returns, (5) Return on assets = Net income / Average total assets — asset efficiency.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Consolidation eliminates all intercompany balances and transactions because the consolidated entity is presented as a single economic entity. Key eliminations: (1) intercompany sales/purchases, (2) intercompany receivables/payables, (3) intercompany profit in inventory (unrealized downstream and upstream profits), (4) intercompany profit in fixed assets (unrealized gain on land or depreciable asset transfers), (5) intercompany dividends, (6) intercompany interest/loans.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Since ASC 810-10-45 (SFAS 160), NCI is presented: (1) Balance sheet — within equity, but separate from the parent\'s equity, (2) Income statement — net income attributable to NCI is presented as a deduction from consolidated net income to arrive at net income attributable to the parent. NCI is measured at fair value at the acquisition date (full goodwill method). Changes in ownership that do not result in loss of control are treated as equity transactions.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'ASC 740-10-25 (FIN 48) uses a two-step approach: (1) Recognition — recognize the tax position only if it is more likely than not (>50%) to be sustained based on technical merits, (2) Measurement — measure the benefit at the largest amount with greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) are disclosed in financial statements. Interest and penalties on UTBs are classified per entity policy (either income tax expense or other). Annual reconciliation of UTBs is required.',
