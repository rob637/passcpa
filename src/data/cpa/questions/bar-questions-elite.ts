    question: 'A company improves its EVA from −$500,000 to $200,000 over one year by reducing invested capital from $12 million to $8 million while maintaining NOPAT at $1 million and WACC at 12.5%. Which strategy drove the improvement?',
    options: [
      'Increasing NOPAT through higher revenue',
      'Reducing the cost of capital (WACC)',
      'Capital efficiency — divesting underperforming assets to reduce invested capital',
      'All three strategies were applied equally',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The three levers to improve EVA are: increase NOPAT, reduce WACC, or reduce invested capital. Since NOPAT ($1M) and WACC (12.5%) stayed constant while invested capital decreased from $12M to $8M, the improvement came from capital efficiency — divesting underperforming assets. Year 1 EVA = $1M − ($12M × 12.5%) = $1M − $1.5M = −$500K. Year 2 EVA = $1M − ($8M × 12.5%) = $1M − $1M = $0. The actual improvement to $200K suggests slightly higher NOPAT or lower capital.',

    question: 'A project has three possible NPV outcomes: optimistic ($800K, 25% probability), most likely ($200K, 50% probability), and pessimistic (−$300K, 25% probability). What is the expected NPV, and should the risk-neutral company accept the project?',

    'Expected NPV = $225K; accept, since expected value is positive',

    'Expected NPV = $100K; accept, but consider hedging the downside',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Expected NPV = (0.25 × $800K) + (0.50 × $200K) + (0.25 × −$300K) = $200K + $100K − $75K = $225K. For a risk-neutral company, a positive expected NPV of $225K supports acceptance. However, a risk-averse company might also consider the 25% probability of a $300K loss and evaluate whether the potential downside is acceptable relative to the expected gain.',

The actual cost of $76.50 exceeds the Q2 target of $75.27, so the kaizen target was NOT met. Kaizen costing focuses on continuous incremental improvement, requiring costs to decrease each period.',

      'Minimize payback',
      'Accept all positive NPV projects',
      'Maximize total investment',
      'Maximize total NPV or profitability index within the budget constraint',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Capital rationing: limited funds, can\'t accept all positive NPV projects. Maximize total NPV within budget. Profitability index (NPV/Investment) helps rank. Consider project divisibility, interdependencies.',
