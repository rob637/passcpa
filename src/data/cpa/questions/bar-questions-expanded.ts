    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-10-55-24, arrangements contingent on continued employment are generally treated as post-combination compensation expense, not purchase consideration. The key indicator is that the payments are linked to service (employee retention), not to transferring ownership.

    options: [
