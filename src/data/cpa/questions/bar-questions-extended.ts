    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Horizontal analysis index = (Current Year / Base Year) × 100 = ($1,016K / $800K) × 100 = 127.0%. This means Year 4 revenue is 27% higher than the base year. Horizontal analysis tracks trends by expressing each year\'s amount as a percentage of a chosen base year, making it easy to spot growth or decline patterns over multiple periods.',

Using expected value: fixed = $50,000 + variable = 80% × ($30,000 ÷ 3 years) = $8,000/year. Total annual transaction price = $50,000 + $8,000 = $58,000.

    question: 'A lessee enters a 7-year lease for equipment with a fair value of $500,000. The agreement includes a purchase option the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Annual lease payments total $380,000 in present value. How should this lease be classified?',

      'Finance lease — the lease term exceeds 75% of useful life',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-10-25-2, a lease is classified as a finance lease if any one of five criteria is met. A purchase option the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise is one of the five criteria. Even though PV of payments ($380,000) is less than 90% of fair value ($450,000), the purchase option alone triggers finance lease classification. Other criteria include: transfer of ownership, lease term ≥ major part of useful life, PV ≥ substantially all of FV, and specialized use.',

      '$0 — NOL carryforwards do not require a valuation allowance',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 740-10-30-5, a valuation allowance reduces a DTA to the amount more likely than not to be realized. With $800,000 DTA but only $500,000 of projected taxable income, only $500,000 is realizable. Valuation allowance = $800,000 − $500,000 = $300,000.
