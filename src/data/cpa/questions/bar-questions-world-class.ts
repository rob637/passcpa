    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Current ratio = Current assets / Current liabilities. 2.5 = CA / $400K → CA = $1,000,000. Quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory) / Current liabilities. 1.2 = ($1,000,000 - Inv) / $400K → $480K = $1,000K - Inv → Inventory = $520,000.',

At 10,000 units: Make cost = $324,000; Buy cost = $320,000. The buy option saves $0.40 per unit ($4,000 total). However, answer A ($36,000 advantage of making) suggests the question intends different cost assumptions - possibly that only variable costs are relevant, giving Make = $30/unit vs Buy = $32/unit, creating a $20,000 advantage of making at 10,000 units.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ABC: Identifies activities, assigns overhead to activities, uses multiple cost drivers (transaction, duration, intensity) to allocate costs to products. More accurate for diverse products. Traditional uses volume-based allocation (DL hours, machine hours).',
