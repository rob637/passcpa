    question: 'A company has cash of $40,000, marketable securities of $25,000, accounts receivable of $60,000, inventory of $90,000, and current liabilities of $100,000. What is the cash ratio?',

      '0.65',
      '1.25',
      '0.40',
      '2.15',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Cash ratio = (Cash + Marketable Securities) / Current Liabilities = ($40,000 + $25,000) / $100,000 = $65,000 / $100,000 = 0.65. The cash ratio is the most conservative liquidity measure, counting only cash and near-cash equivalents. It answers: \'Can the company pay its current liabilities immediately without collecting receivables?\'',

    question: 'Trident Corp. reports net income of $600,000, average total equity of $3,000,000, and average total assets of $5,000,000. If Trident pays $150,000 in preferred dividends, what is the ROE available to common shareholders?',

      '15%',
      '12%',
      '10%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ROE available to common shareholders = (Net Income − Preferred Dividends) ÷ Average Common Equity. Using total equity as a proxy for common equity: ($600,000 − $150,000) ÷ $3,000,000 = $450,000 ÷ $3,000,000 = 15%.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Converting bonds to stock decreases liabilities (bonds payable removed) and increases equity (common stock and APIC). Both effects reduce the D/E ratio. Issuing bonds increases liabilities (raises D/E). Paying dividends reduces equity (raises D/E). Recording an impairment loss reduces equity through retained earnings (raises D/E).',

What governance issue exists?',
    options: [
      'The CIO has inherent authority to approve IT projects regardless of the governance charter',

The IT steering committee provides oversight, risk assessment, and alignment validation. Bypassing this governance control for projects modifying the financial reporting system is especially concerning because: (1) financial reporting system changes require rigorous change management, (2) $850,000 in unapproved spending indicates weak financial controls, and (3) the pattern suggests a tone-at-the-top governance weakness.',
