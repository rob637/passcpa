    question: 'During an audit of a retail chain, the auditor discovers that the client changed its inventory valuation method from FIFO to weighted average during the year but did not disclose the change in the notes to the financial statements. The effect on net income is material. What type of opinion should the auditor issue?',
    options: [
      'Unmodified opinion with an emphasis-of-matter paragraph',
      'Qualified opinion due to a material departure from GAAP for failure to disclose the accounting change',
      'Adverse opinion because all accounting method changes result in pervasive misstatements',
      'Disclaimer of opinion because the auditor cannot determine the correct inventory valuation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 250, changes in accounting principle require disclosure of the nature and reason for the change, and the effect on financial statements. Failure to disclose a material accounting change is a departure from GAAP. Since the effect is material but not pervasive, a qualified opinion is appropriate.',
