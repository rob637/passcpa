    question: 'A taxpayer donated clothing valued at $400 to a qualified charitable organization. The clothing was purchased 3 years ago for $1,200. The taxpayer itemizes deductions. What is the charitable deduction?',
    options: [
    '$400 — the fair market value of donated property in good condition',

    '$800 — the difference between cost and FMV',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Charitable deductions for donated property are generally based on fair market value at the time of donation. For ordinary income property (clothing is not a capital asset and has declined in value), the deduction is limited to FMV. Donated clothing must be in good used condition or better to qualify for a deduction. The $400 FMV is deductible as an itemized deduction on Schedule A. No appraisal is required for donations under $5,000.',

    question: 'An organization stores its financial data backups on magnetic tape. The auditor discovers that the tapes are tested for data integrity when they are first written, but no subsequent integrity testing is performed. Some tapes are 5 years old and stored in a climate-controlled facility. When the auditor requests a test restoration from a 3-year-old tape, the restoration fails due to media degradation. What should the auditor conclude?',
    options: [
      'Initial integrity testing is sufficient for the life of the backup media',
      'Magnetic tape degrades over time and requires periodic integrity testing \u2014 the failed restoration demonstrates that the organization cannot rely on aged backup media for disaster recovery, and its financial data recovery capability is compromised',
      'Climate-controlled storage prevents all media degradation',
      'Tape backup integrity testing is not a control relevant to the financial audit',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Magnetic tape has a limited reliable lifespan and is subject to degradation from: (1) environmental factors (even in climate-controlled facilities), (2) physical wear, (3) magnetic decay, (4) format obsolescence.

    options: [
      'IT strategic plans are valid indefinitely once approved',
      'An outdated IT strategic plan that has not been reviewed in 4 years and does not address current technology trends and threats indicates a governance failure \u2014 the board is not exercising its oversight responsibility for IT strategy, and the organization\'s IT investments may not align with current business needs and risk landscape',

      'Technology changes too quickly to maintain a strategic plan',

What IT general control weakness exists?',
    options: [
      'Short passwords without complexity requirements are acceptable for internal systems',
      'The password policy is fundamentally inadequate \u2014 4-character passwords without complexity can be cracked in seconds through brute force, no account lockout enables unlimited login attempts, and no expiration means compromised passwords remain valid indefinitely, all creating unauthorized access risk to the financial reporting system',
      'Password policies are user convenience features, not security controls',
      'Modern systems compensate for weak passwords through other means',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Password controls are foundational IT general controls. The weaknesses include: (1) 4-character passwords have approximately 1.5 million combinations \u2014 crackable in seconds, (2) no lockout allows unlimited brute force attempts, (3) no expiration means a compromised password provides persistent access.

    question: 'An organization uses multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access to its financial reporting application. During testing, the auditor discovers that MFA is only enforced for remote access but not for on-premises logins. What should the auditor assess?',
    options: [
      'MFA for remote access is sufficient and no further testing is needed',
      'The gap in MFA enforcement for on-premises access, whether compensating controls exist (network access controls, physical security), and whether the risk of insider threats or unauthorized on-site access is adequately mitigated',
      'On-premises access never requires MFA because physical building security is sufficient',
      'The auditor should recommend removing MFA entirely to simplify access',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Partial MFA enforcement creates an inconsistent security posture. While remote MFA addresses external threats, insider threats and compromised on-site devices can bypass authentication protections. The auditor should evaluate physical access controls, network segmentation, and endpoint security measures.',
