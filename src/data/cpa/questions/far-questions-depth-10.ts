    question: 'A company sells $1,000,000 in gift cards during Year 1. Based on historical data, 8% of gift cards are never redeemed (breakage). Under ASC 606, when should breakage revenue be recognized?',
    options: [
      'Entirely at the time of sale',
      'In proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (proportional method) if breakage can be reasonably estimated',
      'Only when the gift cards expire',
      'Never — unredeemed gift cards remain as a liability indefinitely',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-55-49, breakage represents the portion of prepaid amounts (gift cards, loyalty points, vouchers) that customers are not expected to exercise. If the entity expects to be entitled to breakage, it recognizes the expected breakage amount in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer. For example, if 30% of redemptions occur in Year 1, then 30% × $80,000 (8% × $1,000,000) = $24,000 breakage revenue is recognized in Year 1. If breakage CANNOT be reasonably estimated, the entity recognizes revenue only when the likelihood of the customer exercising remaining rights becomes remote.',

The standalone selling price of the machine is $50,000 and the extended warranty is $3,000. How is the $53,000 total transaction price allocated?',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-55-30, assurance-type warranties (that the product meets agreed-upon specifications) are NOT separate performance obligations — they are accounted for as warranty accruals under ASC 460. Service-type warranties (providing a service beyond fixing defects) ARE separate performance obligations. The $50,000 is allocated to the machine and recognized at delivery. The $3,000 is allocated to the extended warranty (a distinct service) and recognized as revenue over the 2-year extended warranty period (straight-line, since the customer benefits evenly over time).

    question: 'A company owns 20% of Entity X (equity method, carrying amount $500,000). It acquires an additional 60% for $2,400,000, gaining control. At the acquisition date, Entity X\'s identifiable net assets have a fair value of $3,000,000, and the fair value of the previously held 20% interest is $600,000. What amount of goodwill is recognized?',
    options: [
      '$400,000',
      '$600,000 — total consideration ($2,400,000 + $600,000) minus 80% of net assets ($2,400,000)',
      '$900,000',
      '$300,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-10-25-10, in a step acquisition where control is achieved, the previously held equity interest is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date, and a gain/loss is recognized. The goodwill calculation depends on whether the full goodwill method or partial goodwill method is used. Using the partial goodwill method (proportionate share of NCI): Total consideration = Cash paid ($2,400,000) + Fair value of previously held interest ($600,000) = $3,000,000. Parent\'s 80% share of identifiable net assets = 80% × $3,000,000 = $2,400,000. Goodwill attributable to parent = $3,000,000 − $2,600,000 = $400,000. A $100,000 gain ($600,000 FV − $500,000 carrying amount) on the remeasured 20% interest is recognized in income separately from the business combination accounting.',

The NOL can be carried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80% of taxable income in future years. What deferred tax asset is recorded (assuming realization is more likely than not)?',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 740-10-30-5, a deferred tax asset (DTA) is recognized for the benefit of NOL carryforwards at the enacted tax rate. DTA = $500,000 × 21% = $105,000. The 80% limitation does not reduce the DTA itself — it only affects how quickly the NOL can be utilized in future years (i.e., in any given year, the NOL deduction is limited to 80% of that year\'s taxable income). A valuation allowance is needed if it is MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (>50%) that some or all of the DTA will not be realized. Under TCJA, post-2017 NOLs carry forward indefinitely (no 20-year expiration) but cannot be carried back (except for farming losses).',

    question: 'A company has a gross DTA of $200,000 from temporary differences and NOL carryforwards. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, which source of future taxable income is LEAST reliable under ASC 740?',
    options: [

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 740-10-30-18, entities evaluate four sources of future taxable income to assess DTA realizability: (1) Future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences — the most reliable because they will definitely reverse. (2) Taxable income in prior carryback years — reliable if available, but TCJA eliminated most carrybacks. (3) Future taxable income exclusive of reversals — requires estimation and judgment, moderately reliable. (4) Tax planning strategies — prudent and feasible actions the entity would take to prevent an NOL or credit from expiring; these are the LEAST reliable because they are hypothetical, may involve costs, and require implementation. A valuation allowance is needed when it is more likely than not the DTA will not be realized.',

    difficulty: 'hard',

    question: 'Under ASU 2020-06, how is a convertible bond with no beneficial conversion feature or cash conversion feature accounted for by the issuer?',

      'Bifurcated into a debt component and an equity component',

      'At fair value with changes in OCI',
      'As equity only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2020-06 simplified the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the beneficial conversion feature (BCF) and cash conversion feature (CCF) models. Under the new guidance, most convertible bonds are accounted for as a single unit of account — entirely as a liability measured at amortized cost. No equity component is separately recognized unless the conversion feature meets the definition of a derivative that must be bifurcated under ASC 815. This results in lower interest expense (no discount amortization from separating the equity component) and a higher liability compared to the old models. Diluted EPS uses the if-converted method (treasury stock method eliminated for convertible debt).',

      'The transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 860-10-40-5, a transfer of financial assets qualifies as a SALE if all three conditions are met: (1) The assets are isolated from the transferor (beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy). (2) The transferee (or beneficial interest holders) has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received. (3) The transferor does NOT maintain effective control over the transferred assets (no agreement to repurchase before maturity at a fixed price). If the transferor DOES maintain effective control (such as a repurchase agreement), the transfer is accounted for as a secured borrowing, not a sale.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under GAAP, consignment goods remain in the inventory of the consignor, not the consignee. The consignor retains legal title and the risks and rewards of ownership until the goods are sold to an end customer by the consignee. The consignee merely holds the goods as an agent for the consignor and reports the goods as a memorandum entry (off-balance sheet). When the consignee sells the goods, the consignor recognizes revenue and removes the goods from inventory. The consignee earns a commission or the difference between selling price and the amount due to the consignor.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the conventional retail method (lower-of-cost-or-market), net markdowns are EXCLUDED from the cost-to-retail percentage calculation (but net markups are INCLUDED). This produces a lower cost-to-retail ratio (conservative), which approximates the lower-of-cost-or-market valuation. In contrast, the average cost retail method includes BOTH net markups and net markdowns in the ratio. The LIFO retail method also excludes markdowns and markups from the beginning inventory layer but includes them for the current period. The retail method is commonly used by department stores and retailers with large inventories and similar markup percentages.',

Ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not extend the useful life or add value are expensed as incurred. Examples of capitalizable costs: major overhauls, additions, improvements, betterments.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under SYD method: Sum of the years = 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15. Depreciable basis = $120,000 − $10,000 = $110,000. Each year\'s depreciation uses the fraction (remaining useful life / sum of years): Year 1: 5/15 × $110,000 = $36,667. Year 2: 4/15 × $110,000 = $29,333. Year 3: 3/15 × $110,000 = $22,000. Year 4: 2/15 × $110,000 = $14,667. Year 5: 1/15 × $110,000 = $7,333. SYD is an accelerated depreciation method — more depreciation in early years, less in later years — appropriate for assets that lose more utility in early periods.

This includes costs for designing, testing, and developing a new product or process. However, legal fees, filing fees, and other costs directly associated with OBTAINING the patent (the legal registration) ARE capitalized as the cost of the patent intangible asset.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the effective interest method (ASC 835), interest expense is calculated by multiplying the carrying amount of the bond by the effective (market) interest rate. Year 1 interest expense = $950,000 × 7.2% = $68,400. Cash interest paid = $1,000,000 × 6% = $60,000. The difference ($68,400 − $60,000 = $8,400) is the discount amortization, increasing the carrying amount to $958,400.

(2) Interest cost — growth in the PBO due to passage of time (PBO × discount rate). (3) Expected return on plan assets — reduces pension cost (positive return reduces expense). (4) Amortization of prior service cost — from plan amendments, amortized from AOCI (not recognized immediately in income). (5) Amortization of net actuarial gains/losses — per corridor approach. (6) Amortization of transition obligation/asset (if any). Plan amendments create prior service cost that goes to OCI first, then is amortized — NOT expensed immediately in net income.',

      'Are written off as a loss',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 860, an assignment (pledging) of receivables is a secured borrowing, NOT a sale. The receivables remain on the assignor\'s balance sheet as collateral. The cash received from the lender is recorded as a loan payable (Notes Payable — Assigned Receivables). Collections from the assigned receivables are used to repay the loan, plus interest and service fees. The assignor must disclose: (1) the amount of receivables assigned, (2) the terms of the assignment. If the debtor defaults on the receivables, the lender has recourse to the assignor (with-recourse) or may bear the loss (without-recourse, which may qualify as a sale).',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 460-10-25-4, a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the guarantee at inception (issuance date), even if the likelihood of payment is considered remote. The initial measurement is the stand-ready obligation — what a third party would charge to issue the same guarantee. This liability is separate from any contingent loss that may be recognized under ASC 450 if payment becomes probable. Over time, the initial guarantee liability is reduced as the guarantor is released from risk (typically ratably over the guarantee term). If payment becomes probable, the ASC 450 loss contingency may exceed the remaining guarantee liability.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When a company issues stock rights (preemptive rights) to existing shareholders, the rights are issued proportionally and represent a distribution of value from the existing shares. The company makes a memorandum entry only at the time of issuance — no formal journal entry is required. No compensation expense is recognized because the rights go to all existing shareholders proportionally (not to employees). When the rights are exercised, the company records: Debit Cash ($30 × shares), Credit Common Stock (par), Credit APIC (excess). If the rights expire unexercised, no entry is needed. The shareholder allocates a portion of their basis to the rights (for tax purposes).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 340-40-25-1, incremental costs to obtain a contract (costs that would NOT have been incurred without the contract, such as sales commissions) are capitalized as an asset if the entity expects to recover those costs. The asset is amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods/services — typically over the contract period, or over the expected customer relationship period if the commission relates to renewals. The $20,000 commission is capitalized and amortized over 3 years ($6,667/year) or longer if renewals are expected. A practical expedient allows immediate expensing if the amortization period would be one year or less.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 740-20-45-2 (intra-period tax allocation), the tax effect of items reported in OCI is allocated to OCI, NOT to income tax expense. The $50,000 unrealized gain creates a taxable temporary difference, resulting in a DTL of $50,000 × 21% = $10,500. The DTL is recorded with the offset going to OCI: Debit OCI $10,500, Credit DTL $10,500. The OCI presentation shows: Unrealized gain $50,000, Tax effect ($10,500), Net-of-tax OCI $39,500.

This is an important distinction because the ROU asset typically has a shorter remaining term than the underlying asset. The classification criteria (ownership transfer, purchase option, lease term, PV of payments, specialized asset) are applied using the ROU asset\'s characteristics. The intermediate lessor continues to recognize the head lease liability and ROU asset (unless the head lease is terminated).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 815-25-35, in a fair value hedge: (1) The hedging instrument (the swap) is marked to fair value with changes reported in net income. (2) The hedged item (the fixed-rate bond) is ALSO adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk (interest rate changes), with the adjustment reported in net income. This creates an offset — ideally, the gain on the swap offsets the loss on the bond (or vice versa), resulting in minimal net income impact if the hedge is highly effective. The bond\'s carrying amount on the balance sheet is adjusted for the cumulative fair value hedge adjustment. This differs from a cash flow hedge, where the hedging instrument\'s changes go to OCI.',
