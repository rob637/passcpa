    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-45-2, a contract liability exists when a customer pays consideration (or the amount is due) before the entity transfers the promised good or service. Common examples include: advance payments, magazine subscriptions, gift cards, prepaid memberships, and customer deposits. The contract liability (deferred revenue) is recognized as revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the corresponding performance obligation by transferring the good or service. On the balance sheet, contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on when performance is expected.',

    question: 'A manufacturer/dealer lessor enters a sales-type lease with the following terms: Fair value of equipment $300,000, cost to lessor $220,000, annual lease payments $45,000, 8-year term, implicit rate 6%, no residual value. At commencement, what selling profit does the lessor recognize?',

      '$300,000',
      '$45,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-30-25-1, for a sales-type lease, the lessor recognizes at commencement: (1) A net investment in the lease (lease receivable at PV of payments). (2) Derecognizes the underlying asset. (3) Selling profit = Fair value of asset (or PV of lease payments + PV of unguaranteed residual, if lower) minus the carrying amount of the asset. Selling profit = $300,000 − $220,000 = $80,000. This profit is recognized immediately (not deferred). The lessor also recognizes interest income over the lease term on the net investment. For direct financing leases, in contrast, selling profit is deferred and recognized as part of interest income over the lease term.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-55-86, customer acceptance clauses affect the timing of revenue recognition. If acceptance is a formality (the entity can objectively determine the product meets specifications), revenue may be recognized before formal acceptance. If acceptance is substantive (there is uncertainty whether the product meets specifications or the customer has a genuine ability to reject), revenue is deferred until acceptance occurs or the acceptance period lapses. The entity must evaluate whether the customer has obtained control of the asset, considering: (1) transfer of physical possession, (2) transfer of risks and rewards, (3) legal title transfer, (4) customer acceptance.',

      'A reduction of the cost of the replacement asset',
      'The gain is deferred until a replacement asset is purchased',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under GAAP (ASC 605-40 for gains prior to ASC 606 adoption, and general recognition principles), when an asset is involuntarily converted (destroyed by fire, stolen, condemned by government), a gain or loss is recognized as the difference between insurance proceeds (or condemnation award) and the carrying amount of the destroyed asset. Gain = $500,000 − $400,000 = $100,000, recognized in the period of the event. Under GAAP, there is NO deferral of gain for involuntary conversions (unlike tax law, where IRC §1033 allows deferral if a replacement asset is purchased within a specified period). The gain is typically reported as a separate line item or within other income.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 323-10-35-33, when an investor obtains significant influence and transitions from ASC 321 (fair value or measurement alternative) to the equity method, the equity method is applied prospectively beginning on the date significant influence is obtained. The investment\'s carrying amount at the transition date is the fair value measurement ($180,000 if the investment was at FV through NI) or the measurement alternative amount. Any unrealized gain ($30,000) that had been recognized through net income under ASC 321 is not reversed. Going forward, the equity method is applied using $180,000 as the starting basis, with the investor picking up its 30% share of investee earnings/losses and adjusting for dividends.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under APB 4 and ASC 740, companies may choose between two methods for investment tax credits (ITC): (1) Flow-through method: The entire ITC is recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the qualifying asset is placed in service. (2) Deferral method: The ITC is deferred (as a liability or contra-asset) and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the useful life of the related asset. APB 4 permits either method, making this one of the few areas where GAAP allows an accounting policy choice with materially different results.

      '$160,000 — after deducting preferred dividends, remaining income allocated based on shares',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under the two-class method (ASC 260-10-45-60B), participating securities share in undistributed earnings. Step 1: Allocate preferred dividend: 20,000 × $5 × 8% = $8,000. Step 2: Remaining undistributed earnings = $200,000 − $8,000 = $192,000. Step 3: Allocate remaining earnings based on sharing rights. If the preferred participates equally based on number of shares: Common share = 100,000/120,000 × $192,000 = $160,000. Preferred share = 20,000/120,000 × $192,000 = $32,000 + $8,000 = $40,000. Basic EPS for common = $160,000 ÷ 100,000 = $1.60. The two-class method prevents common EPS from being overstated when participating securities are entitled to share in undistributed earnings.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 410-20-35-5, when the estimated cash flows for an ARO change (an upward revision increases the liability), the change is measured using the current credit-adjusted risk-free rate and: (1) added to the ARO liability (increasing it from $100,000 to $150,000 at present value), and (2) capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The additional capitalized cost is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset. For downward revisions (decreases in estimated cost), the reduction is measured using the original discount rate for that layer. This \'layer\' approach ensures each revision uses the appropriate rate.',

The note is recorded at present value: $62,092. The equipment is also recorded at $62,092. Discount = $100,000 − $62,092 = $37,908. Year 1 interest expense = $62,092 × 10% = $6,209 (effective interest method). This increases the note\'s carrying amount to $62,092 + $6,209 = $68,301. Year 2 interest = $68,301 × 10% = $6,830.

Factors indicating reasonable certainty include: (1) significant leasehold improvements whose value would be lost, (2) costs to terminate (penalties), (3) importance of the underlying asset to the lessee\'s operations, (4) availability of suitable alternatives. Here, the significant leasehold improvements create a strong economic incentive to renew, making it reasonably certain the lessee will exercise the renewal option.

When variances are immaterial, they are typically closed entirely to COGS for simplicity. A favorable material price variance means actual cost was less than standard, so COGS is credited (reduced) by the variance amount. If variances are material, they should be allocated proportionally between ending inventory and COGS (and work-in-process, if applicable) to approximate actual cost.

    explanation: 'Under ASC 350-30-35-4, the useful life of an intangible asset should consider the expected period of benefit, including renewal periods if renewals can be obtained without substantial cost or modification. Since the franchise includes a renewal option for an additional 20 years at a "nominal fee" (virtually no cost), the entity can expect to benefit for the full 40 years.

      'A sale with a right of return',
      'A financing arrangement — no revenue is recognized, and the $10,000 difference is recognized as interest expense over 12 months',
      'A consignment arrangement',
      'Revenue of $100,000 with a separate repurchase liability of $110,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-55-70, when an entity has an obligation or right to repurchase the asset (a forward or call option), and the repurchase price is greater than the original selling price, the transaction is accounted for as a FINANCING arrangement (not a sale). The entity: (1) Does NOT derecognize the asset. (2) Recognizes a financial liability of $100,000. (3) Recognizes the difference ($110,000 − $100,000 = $10,000) as interest expense (or cost of financing) over the 12-month period. The customer does not obtain control of the asset because the entity\'s obligation to repurchase indicates the company has not transferred control.',

      '$3,000,000 as an asset',
      'No liability until the line of credit is fully drawn',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A revolving line of credit creates a liability only for the amount actually borrowed (drawn). The company reports $2,000,000 as a current or noncurrent liability (based on the credit facility terms), and discloses the total credit line ($5,000,000) and the unused/available portion ($3,000,000) in the notes. The undrawn portion is not a liability — it is a commitment from the lender. Debt issuance costs for revolving credit facilities are uniquely treated as an asset (rather than a direct deduction from the liability) under ASU 2015-15, amortized over the term of the facility.',

      'No tax allocation — discontinued operations are reported net of tax at the total level',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 740-20-45 (intra-period tax allocation), the total tax expense ($300,000 × 21% = $63,000) is ALLOCATED to each component of income: (1) Income from continuing operations: $500,000 × 21% = $105,000 tax expense reported with continuing operations. (2) Discontinued operations: -$200,000 × 21% = -$42,000 tax benefit reported with the discontinued operations line item. Discontinued operations are presented "net of tax" on the income statement: Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax benefit of $42,000 = $158,000 net loss. This ensures each section of the income statement reflects its own tax consequences.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 480-10-25 (Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity), financial instruments that embody an unconditional obligation to transfer assets at a specified or determinable date must be classified as LIABILITIES, not equity. Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock has a fixed redemption date, creating an unconditional obligation. This contrasts with: (1) Callable preferred stock (issuer has the option to redeem — remains as equity). (2) Puttable preferred stock redeemable at the holder\'s option — classified in mezzanine/temporary equity (between liabilities and equity) under ASR 268 for SEC registrants.

The unrealized gain is NOT recognized in net income. When the security is subsequently sold, the cumulative unrealized gain/loss in AOCI is reclassified to net income (as a reclassification adjustment).

If fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the entity measures the noncash consideration indirectly by reference to the standalone selling price of the goods or services promised to the customer. For example, if a customer provides equipment worth $50,000 in exchange for consulting services, the entity recognizes $50,000 in revenue as the performance obligation is satisfied.',

Entry: Debit Accumulated Depreciation $250,000, Debit Loss on Abandonment $50,000, Credit Equipment $300,000. The $50,000 loss is reported in the income statement as part of operating expenses (or other losses). If the asset has no remaining book value (fully depreciated), the abandonment creates no gain or loss — just a removal of both the asset and accumulated depreciation.

    explanation: 'Under ASC 450 and related interpretive guidance, loss contingencies and expected insurance recoveries must NOT be netted. The company accrues the full $500,000 loss when probable and estimable. The $300,000 insurance recovery is recognized as a receivable only when recovery is probable (virtually certain in some interpretations). The expected recovery is reported as a separate receivable or gain — NOT as a reduction of the loss. On the income statement, the $500,000 loss and $300,000 recovery may appear in different line items.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-740-25-2, temporary differences arising from the difference between the fair values assigned to acquired assets/liabilities and their tax bases require recognition of deferred taxes at the acquisition date. FV exceeds tax basis by $1,000,000 → this will be taxable when depreciation/amortization for book exceeds tax, creating a taxable temporary difference and a DTL of $1,000,000 × 21% = $210,000. The DTL increases the liabilities assumed in the acquisition, which in turn increases goodwill by $210,000. This is one of the most tested intersections of business combinations and income tax accounting on the CPA exam.',
