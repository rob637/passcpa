    question: 'An acquirer recognizes contingent consideration of $200,000 (fair value) at the acquisition date. One year later, the fair value is $250,000 due to the target exceeding earnings thresholds. Under ASC 805, the $50,000 change is:',

      'Reported in OCI',
      'Ignored until the contingency is settled',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-30-35-1, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are recognized in net income in each subsequent reporting period. This is NOT a measurement-period adjustment (which adjusts goodwill). Measurement-period adjustments relate to new information about facts that existed at the acquisition date and occur within one year. Changes in fair value due to events AFTER the acquisition date (such as exceeding an earnings target) are income statement items. If contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured — the settlement is recorded within equity.',

Under ASC 350-30-35-17A, IPR&D is treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset — NOT amortized until the related project is completed or abandoned. While indefinite-lived, IPR&D is tested for impairment annually (consistent with other indefinite-lived intangibles). Once the project is completed, the asset is reclassified to a finite-lived intangible and amortized over its useful life.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-20-55-11, an intangible asset is identifiable (and recognized separately from goodwill) if it meets EITHER of two criteria: (1) Contractual-legal criterion: It arises from contractual or legal rights (e.g., patents, trademarks, franchise agreements, customer contracts). (2) Separability criterion: It is capable of being separated from the entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged (e.g., customer lists, trade secrets, databases). The acquiree need NOT have previously recognized the intangible on its own books. Assembled workforce does NOT meet either criterion and remains part of goodwill.',

      '$30,000 eliminated entirely against NCI',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'For upstream sales (subsidiary sells to parent): Unrealized intercompany profit = ($100,000 − $70,000) × 30% unsold = $9,000. In the eliminating entry: Debit Sales $100,000, Credit COGS $91,000, Credit Inventory $9,000. Since this is an UPSTREAM sale, the subsidiary recorded the profit. Therefore, the unrealized profit elimination reduces the subsidiary\'s income, which affects both the controlling and noncontrolling interests in proportion to their ownership: NCI absorbs 20% × $9,000 = $1,800 of the eliminated profit. For downstream sales (parent sells to subsidiary), the parent absorbs 100% of the elimination — NCI is not affected.',

When elected, the acquired entity\'s assets and liabilities are adjusted to the acquisition-date fair values established by the acquirer, including recognition of goodwill. The election is available when a change-in-control event occurs (e.g., a new parent company obtains >50% ownership). The election can be made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Previously, SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins (SAB 54/73) provided guidance on when push-down was required — ASU 2014-17 simplified this to a free election.',

      'Increase consolidated depreciation expense by $3,333 (to depreciate at original basis: $60,000/6 = $10,000 vs. $80,000/6 = $13,333, difference is additional depreciation needed)',
      'Decrease depreciation by $3,333 to reflect the original cost basis',
      'Increase depreciation by $6,667',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'From the consolidated entity\'s perspective, no sale occurred — the asset should remain at its original basis: Cost $100,000, Accum. Dep. $40,000, NBV $60,000. Subsidiary records: Cost $80,000, depreciated over 6 years = $13,333/year. Consolidated depreciation should be: $60,000 ÷ 6 = $10,000/year. Adjustment: DECREASE consolidated depreciation by $3,333 ($13,333 − $10,000). The $20,000 gain on the intercompany sale ($80,000 − $60,000 NBV) is eliminated in consolidation. Over 6 years, the $20,000 gain is realized through $3,333/year lower depreciation, ultimately bringing the total depreciation back in line.',

      'Presented in the foreign currency without translation',
      'Converted using purchasing power parity rates',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 830-10-45-11, when cumulative inflation in a foreign country exceeds approximately 100% over three years, the economy is considered highly inflationary. The functional currency of the subsidiary is effectively changed to the reporting currency (e.g., U.S. dollar), and the financial statements must be REMEASURED using the temporal method. Monetary items use current rates; nonmonetary items use historical rates. Remeasurement gains/losses go to net income (not OCI). This prevents the distortion that would occur from translating inflation-affected balances at current rates. Examples include Venezuela, Argentina, and Zimbabwe during periods of hyperinflation.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 830-20-35 and ASC 815-35, a net investment hedge offsets the foreign currency exposure of the parent\'s equity investment in a foreign subsidiary. The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument (e.g., a foreign-currency-denominated loan) is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within OCI — the same location where the translation adjustment on the net investment is reported. This creates an offset, reducing the volatility of OCI from foreign currency movements. The CTA amounts are reclassified to net income only upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 815-20-25-104 (the shortcut method for interest rate swaps), if very specific criteria are met (e.g., swap notional = hedged item principal, fair value of swap at inception is zero, filing date matches, swap is not cancellable, etc.), the entity may ASSUME perfect effectiveness — the change in fair value of the swap exactly offsets the change in fair value of the hedged item. No hedge ineffectiveness is recognized, and no ongoing effectiveness testing is required. If any shortcut criteria are not met (or cease to be met), the entity must use another method (e.g., regression, critical terms match).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 260-10-45-48, contingently issuable shares are included in diluted EPS if all necessary conditions have been met as of the end of the reporting period. Since current net income ($1,200,000) exceeds the $1,000,000 threshold, the condition is currently satisfied, and the 50,000 shares are included in the denominator of diluted EPS.

      'Recognized at the full market value of a new franchise agreement',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-20-30-2, a reacquired right (e.g., a franchise right) is recognized as an identifiable intangible asset separately from goodwill. It is measured based on the remaining contractual term of the related agreement — renewal terms are excluded even if market participants would consider renewals. If the reacquired right terms are favorable compared to market, a settlement gain/loss may be recognized. If unfavorable, a settlement loss is recognized in net income. The reacquired right is amortized over the remaining contractual term. This treatment ensures proper identification and measurement of the economic benefit of reacquiring the right.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the current rate method (ASC 830): Assets and liabilities → current rate. Revenues and expenses → exchange rate at transaction date (or weighted-average as an approximation). Capital stock/APIC → HISTORICAL rate at the date the equity was originally issued. Retained earnings is a computed figure (beginning balance + translated net income − translated dividends). The translation adjustment (the balancing amount from using different rates for different elements) is reported in OCI as the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA). This preserves the original dollar amount of the equity investment while allowing balance sheet items to reflect current exchange rates.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 250-10-45-17, a change in accounting estimate is accounted for PROSPECTIVELY. The undepreciated balance (carrying amount minus salvage value) is allocated over the revised remaining useful life beginning in the period of the change. No prior periods are restated. Example: An asset with a cost of $100,000, salvage $10,000, accumulated depreciation of $27,000 after 3 years (original 10-year life). If the remaining life is revised to 5 years (from 7): new annual depreciation = ($100,000 − $10,000 − $27,000) ÷ 5 = $12,600. Changes in estimates are distinguished from changes in principles and error corrections.',

(2) Income approach: Converts future amounts (cash flows, earnings) to a single present amount (e.g., DCF analysis, option pricing models). (3) Cost approach: Reflects the amount required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost less obsolescence).

No gain, loss, or goodwill adjustment is recognized. Entry: Debit NCI $400,000, Debit APIC $100,000 (the premium paid over the NCI carrying amount), Credit Cash $500,000. If the parent sells a portion but retains control, the same equity treatment applies — the difference between proceeds and the carrying amount of the NCI disposed is recorded in APIC.
