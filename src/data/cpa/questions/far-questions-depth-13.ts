      'Reclassified into net income immediately',
      'Reversed against the hedging instrument',
      'Transferred to retained earnings',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 815-30-40-4, when a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is PROBABLE that the forecasted transaction will NOT occur within the originally specified time period, the net gain/loss that was accumulated in OCI is reclassified into earnings IMMEDIATELY. If the hedge is discontinued but the forecasted transaction is still probable, the amounts in AOCI remain until the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the hedging instrument is sold/terminated but the forecasted transaction is still probable, AOCI amounts remain and are reclassified when the transaction occurs. The key distinction is whether the transaction is still probable.',

    question: 'A company designates a futures contract as a fair value hedge of its commodity inventory. During the period, the inventory fair value decreases by $50,000 and the futures contract gains $48,000. Under ASC 815, how is this reported?',
    options: [
      'Net loss of $2,000 in OCI',
      'The $50,000 inventory loss and $48,000 hedging gain are both recognized in net income, with $2,000 ineffectiveness in net income',
      'The $2,000 ineffectiveness is deferred in AOCI',
      'The $48,000 gain offsets the inventory carrying amount directly',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 815-25-35, in a fair value hedge: (1) The gain/loss on the hedging instrument ($48,000 gain) is recognized in net income. (2) The change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk ($50,000 loss) is also recognized in net income (with a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the inventory). The net effect — $2,000 — represents hedge INEFFECTIVENESS, which is always recognized in net income in a fair value hedge. The carrying amount of the inventory is reduced by $50,000 (which will affect COGS when sold). Under ASU 2017-12, the presentation of hedging gains/losses may be in the same income statement line item.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 815-10-15-83, a derivative has THREE defining characteristics: (1) It has one or more underlyings (interest rate, price, exchange rate, etc.) and one or more notional amounts or payment provisions. (2) It requires no initial net investment or a small initial investment relative to direct exposure. (3) Its terms require or permit NET SETTLEMENT (cash settlement, delivery of an easily convertible asset, or market mechanism for settlement). Being traded on an organized exchange is NOT a requirement — over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives like interest rate swaps and forward contracts also qualify.

Jul 1–Dec 31 shares: (100,000 + 20,000) × 2 = 240,000 (6 months). Weighted average = (200,000 × 6/12) + (240,000 × 6/12) = 100,000 + 120,000 = 220,000 shares. The stock split is applied to ALL shares outstanding before the split — including shares issued on July 1. This retrospective treatment ensures EPS comparability.

Commercial substance exists when the entity\'s future cash flows are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. Company A: Records office building at $500,000 (fair value of asset given up, since fair value of asset received may also equal $500,000). Gain = FV of asset given up ($500,000) − Carrying value ($400,000) = $100,000 recognized in net income. If the exchange LACKS commercial substance, the asset received is recorded at the carrying value of the asset given up ($400,000), and NO gain is recognized.

      '$20,000',
      'No gain recognized',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When an exchange lacks commercial substance but boot is RECEIVED, a proportionate share of the gain is recognized based on the ratio of boot to total consideration received. Total gain = FV given ($100,000) − CV ($60,000) = $40,000. Boot proportion = boot / (FV of asset received + boot) = $20,000 / ($80,000 + $20,000) = 20%. Recognized gain = $40,000 × 20% = $8,000. The new asset is recorded at: CV of old asset − boot received + gain recognized = $60,000 − $20,000 + $8,000 = $48,000. Note: If boot received is ≥ 25% of total FV of the exchange, the entire gain is recognized (the transaction is considered monetary). This 25% threshold test is an important factor.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 205-40-50-12, even when substantial doubt is alleviated by management\'s plans, disclosure is still REQUIRED. The disclosures include: (1) Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt (before considering management\'s plans). (2) Management\'s evaluation of the significance of those conditions. (3) Management\'s plans that alleviated the substantial doubt. This "intermediate" disclosure level (doubt raised but alleviated) is less extensive than when doubt is NOT alleviated.

(3) Asset test: Segment assets ≥ 10% of combined segment assets. An EMPLOYEE test does NOT exist. Additionally, the 75% "overall" test requires that external revenues of reportable segments must be ≥ 75% of total consolidated revenues — if not, additional segments must be identified as reportable.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 830-10-45-2, the functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Indicators include: (1) Cash flow indicators: Whether cash flows are primarily in the foreign currency or the parent\'s currency. (2) Sales price indicators: Whether prices are determined by local competition or international markets. (3) Sales market indicators: Principal market location. (4) Expense indicators: Where costs are primarily incurred. (5) Financing indicators: Source of debt and equity capital. (6) Intercompany indicators: Volume of transactions with the parent. Management exercises judgment, but the determination is based on economic substance, not managerial preference. If the economy is highly inflationary (>100% cumulative over 3 years), the reporting currency is used.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 810-10-35-4, the assessment of whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE is a CONTINUOUS assessment. The entity must reconsider whether it is the primary beneficiary whenever facts and circumstances change in a way that affects: (1) The power to direct the VIE\'s most significant activities, or (2) The obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. Events that may trigger reassessment include changes in governing documents, contractual arrangements, ownership interests, or the VIE\'s activities. This continuous reassessment differs from the voting interest model, which generally requires reassessment only upon specific reconsideration events.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASU 2014-08 (codified in ASC 205-20-45-1E), a disposal (or component held for sale) qualifies as a discontinued operation only if it represents a STRATEGIC SHIFT that has (or will have) a MAJOR EFFECT on the entity\'s operations and financial results. Examples include disposal of: (1) A major geographical area of operations. (2) A major line of business. (3) A major equity method investment. (4) Other disposals that are part of a coordinated plan to dispose of a major line or area. This raised the bar from pre-ASU 2014-08 guidance, which required only that the cash flows of the disposed component could be clearly distinguished. The higher threshold reduces the frequency of discontinued operations reporting.',

They are NOT part of the consideration transferred, NOT added to goodwill, and NOT capitalized. The only exception is that costs to issue debt or equity securities are treated per other GAAP: debt issuance costs are amortized over the debt term (ASC 470), and equity issuance costs reduce the proceeds (contra-equity).

(2) The quantity is consistent with the entity\'s normal business usage. (3) The entity documents the election at inception.

This treatment recognizes that long-term intercompany balances function like additional equity investments in the subsidiary, and the foreign currency effects should be treated similarly to translation adjustments.

In this scenario, the receivable existed at year-end and the customer was already experiencing financial difficulties before year-end — the post-balance-sheet bankruptcy filing confirms the deteriorated condition that existed at the balance sheet date. The entity should adjust the financial statements (e.g., increase the allowance for doubtful accounts).
