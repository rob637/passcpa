      'A component of equity, separate from the parent\'s equity',
      'Mezzanine equity (between liabilities and equity)',
      'A contra-asset',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 810-10-45-16, the noncontrolling interest (NCI) is presented in the EQUITY section of the consolidated balance sheet, separately from the parent\'s equity. This changed with SFAS 160/ASC 810 — previously, NCI (minority interest) was often presented between liabilities and equity ("mezzanine") or as a liability. The current guidance recognizes that the NCI represents an ownership interest in the consolidated entity\'s net assets, not a liability. On the income statement, net income is presented for the consolidated entity as a whole, then allocated between: (1) Net income attributable to the parent (controlling interest), and (2) Net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 323-10-15-6, an investor with significant influence (generally 20%–50% ownership) but not control accounts for the investment using the EQUITY METHOD. The investment is initially recorded at cost and adjusted for the investor\'s share of the investee\'s net income/loss and dividends. Consolidation (ASC 810) applies when the investor has CONTROL (generally >50% ownership or primary beneficiary of a VIE). Below 20% (without significant influence), the investment follows ASC 321 — measured at fair value (with changes in NI) or at cost minus impairment plus/minus observable price changes (the practical expedient for investments without readily determinable fair value). The 20% threshold is a rebuttable presumption — significant influence may exist below 20% or be absent above 20%.',

    question: 'In a business combination, the acquirer assigns a fair value of $500,000 to acquired equipment (book value on the acquiree\'s tax return = $300,000, tax rate 25%). Under ASC 805, the deferred tax liability recognized is:',

      '$125,000',
      '$200,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-740-25-2, in a business combination, the acquirer recognizes DEFERRED TAX ASSETS and LIABILITIES for the differences between the acquisition-date fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed versus their tax bases. Equipment: Fair value (book basis) = $500,000. Tax basis = $300,000. Taxable temporary difference = $200,000. DTL = $200,000 × 25% = $50,000. This DTL reduces the net identifiable assets and therefore increases goodwill. The exception: Under ASC 805-740-25-8, deferred taxes are NOT recognized for goodwill that is NOT deductible for tax purposes (or for initial recognition exceptions per ASC 740-10-25-20). Deferred taxes on ALL other fair value adjustments (inventory, real estate, intangibles, etc.) ARE recognized.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 830-230-45-1, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents must be reported as a SEPARATE line item on the statement of cash flows, distinct from operating, investing, and financing activities. The statement of cash flows reconciles: Beginning cash + Operating + Investing + Financing + Effect of exchange rate changes on cash = Ending cash. This separate presentation prevents the distortion of operating, investing, and financing cash flows by exchange rate movements. This line item captures the remeasurement/translation effect on foreign-currency-denominated cash held by the entity (or its foreign subsidiaries). It is typically a relatively small amount unless significant cash is held in foreign currencies during periods of volatile exchange rates.',

      'Add 20,000 shares from January 1',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 260-10-55-12, stock dividends (like stock splits) are applied RETROACTIVELY to ALL prior periods for EPS calculation. The reason is that a stock dividend increases the number of shares without changing the entity\'s net assets — it is merely a change in the unit of measure. All shares outstanding BEFORE the stock dividend are multiplied by the adjustment factor. In this case: Factor = 1.10 (110% of original shares). Shares from January 1 to September 30 = 200,000 × 1.10 = 220,000. Shares from October 1 to December 31 = 220,000 (already at post-dividend level). Weighted average for the full year = 220,000. Prior year EPS is also retroactively adjusted using the 1.10 factor for comparability.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 810-10-45-5, when a subsidiary holds shares of the PARENT (reciprocal/mutual holding), those shares are treated as TREASURY STOCK in the consolidated financial statements. From the consolidated entity\'s perspective, these are the entity\'s own shares held within the group and should be presented as a deduction from consolidated equity, not as an investment asset. The subsidiary\'s investment account for the parent\'s shares is eliminated, and the shares are reclassified as treasury stock. Any dividends paid by the parent on these shares are also eliminated in consolidation (they are essentially intercompany transactions — the consolidated entity paying itself).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 815-30-35, in a qualifying CASH FLOW hedge: the effective portion of the gain/loss on the hedging instrument is reported in OCI. As the hedged variable-rate interest payments are made (and affect earnings), amounts in AOCI are reclassified to net income to offset the variable interest expense. In this case, the $30,000 gain on the swap goes to OCI and will be reclassified to reduce interest expense in the periods the variable-rate interest is paid. This achieves the entity\'s objective: converting variable-rate debt to effectively fixed-rate debt. The swap is reported as an asset (or liability) at fair value on the balance sheet.',

      'Always use the model price of $90,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 820-10-30-3, when fair value at initial recognition differs from the transaction price, a day-one gain/loss is recognized ONLY IF fair value is evidenced by: (1) A quoted price in an active market for an identical item (Level 1), or (2) A valuation technique that uses ONLY observable inputs. If the fair value measurement relies on significant UNOBSERVABLE inputs (Level 3), the transaction price is presumed to be fair value at inception, and NO day-one gain or loss is recognized. In this case, since the model uses at least one significant unobservable input, the derivative is recorded at the transaction price ($100,000). The difference is subsequently recognized as the inputs become observable or the position is closed.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-10-55-25, arrangements that require employees to provide FUTURE SERVICE as a condition for payment are classified as compensation for future services (post-combination expense), NOT as part of the acquisition consideration. Indicators that the arrangement is compensation (not consideration): (1) Payment contingent on continued employment. (2) Payments tied to future service periods. (3) Former owners who remain as employees receive the payment. (4) The arrangement was initiated by the acquirer (not part of pre-combination terms). The $500,000 is expensed over the 2-year requisite service period. This reduces post-acquisition income but does NOT affect goodwill or the acquisition-date purchase price allocation.',

As a practical expedient, a WEIGHTED-AVERAGE rate for the period is commonly used (assuming revenues/expenses are earned/incurred relatively evenly). Specific rates are used for items that occur at identifiable dates (e.g., a large one-time gain). Assets and liabilities → current rate (balance sheet date). Equity (common stock, APIC) → historical rate. Dividends → rate on the declaration date.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASU 2017-04 (ASC 350-20-35-3C), the goodwill impairment test is a ONE-STEP test: Compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount (including goodwill). If carrying amount > fair value, impairment loss = the excess, BUT limited to the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The impairment loss reduces goodwill and is recognized in net income. This simplified the former two-step process (which required a hypothetical purchase price allocation in Step 2). The test is performed ANNUALLY (at the same date each year) and whenever triggering events occur. An optional qualitative assessment (Step 0) may be performed first — if qualitative factors indicate it is more-likely-than-not that fair value exceeds carrying amount, the quantitative test is not required.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-50, transactions between entities under COMMON CONTROL (e.g., transferring a subsidiary from one wholly owned subsidiary to another within the same corporate group) are outside the scope of the acquisition method. Instead, assets and liabilities are transferred at their HISTORICAL (carrying) amounts — the predecessor basis. No goodwill or fair value adjustments are recognized. Financial statements of the receiving entity are retroactively adjusted to include the transferred entity for all periods during which the entities were under common control.

Therefore, the unrealized profit elimination affects only the parent\'s (controlling interest\'s) income — NCI is NOT affected. Unrealized profit = ($200,000 − $140,000) × 40% unsold = $24,000. Eliminating entry: Debit Sales $200,000, Credit COGS $176,000 ($200,000 − $24,000), Credit Inventory $24,000. The entire $24,000 reduction comes from the controlling interest\'s share. This contrasts with UPSTREAM sales (subsidiary sells to parent), where the NCI bears its proportionate share (20% for a 20% NCI) of the unrealized profit elimination because the subsidiary recorded the profit.',

For excluded components, the entity makes an accounting policy election between two approaches: (1) Amortization approach: Changes in fair value of the excluded component are recorded in OCI, then amortized to earnings systematically over the hedging period.

    explanation: 'When a parent makes a downstream sale of inventory to a foreign subsidiary, the unrealized profit (in the subsidiary\'s inventory) is eliminated in consolidation. The profit was recorded by the PARENT (in the parent\'s currency), so the elimination is straightforward in the parent\'s currency. However, the inventory on the subsidiary\'s books is denominated in foreign currency. For elimination purposes, the intercompany profit is translated at the RATE AT THE DATE OF THE INTERCOMPANY SALE — this is consistent with the historical rate treatment of inventory under translation (current rate method — inventory at the current rate, but the intercompany profit elimination uses the transaction-date rate to maintain consistency with the parent\'s recorded amounts).

The auditor evaluates the preferability justification as part of the audit. This requirement prevents entities from manipulating earnings through frequent principle changes.

Dividends paid to NCI shareholders are NOT eliminated — they represent distributions to owners outside the consolidated group.',

    question: 'An acquirer pays $3,000,000 for a target with identifiable net assets of $2,400,000 (fair value). Goodwill is $600,000. The goodwill is NOT deductible for tax purposes. Under ASC 805-740, the acquirer records:',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-740-25-8 (and ASC 740-10-25-3(e)), deferred taxes are NOT recognized on the difference between the assigned (book basis) value and the tax basis of GOODWILL that is NOT deductible for tax purposes. This is the "initial recognition exception" — it prevents a circular computation (recording a DTL on goodwill would increase goodwill, which would increase the DTL, etc.). However, if goodwill IS tax-deductible (common in asset acquisitions for tax purposes), a DTL may arise in SUBSEQUENT periods as tax amortization reduces the tax basis below the book basis. Additionally, deferred taxes ARE recognized on ALL other fair value adjustments to identifiable assets/liabilities in the acquisition.',

    question: 'A company has $1,000,000 of 6% convertible bonds outstanding. Each $1,000 bond is convertible into 50 common shares. The tax rate is 25%. For diluted EPS, the numerator adjustment under the if-converted method is:',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the if-converted method (ASC 260-10-45-40) for convertible bonds: assume the bonds were converted at the beginning of the period. (1) NUMERATOR: Add back the after-tax interest expense that would NOT have been incurred if bonds were converted. Interest = $1,000,000 × 6% = $60,000. Tax savings lost (interest is tax-deductible) = $60,000 × 25% = $15,000. Net add-back = $60,000 − $15,000 = $45,000. (2) DENOMINATOR: Add the shares from conversion = ($1,000,000 / $1,000) × 50 = 50,000 shares. The after-tax treatment is necessary because bond interest is deductible for tax purposes — if the bonds are assumed converted, the tax benefit of the interest deduction is also lost. Include the conversion in diluted EPS only if it is DILUTIVE.',

Even if the acquirer plans to discontinue the trademark, a market participant might use it offensively (actively marketing under the brand). Therefore, the defensive trademark is recognized at fair value based on market participant assumptions. Under ASC 350-30-35-18, a defensive intangible asset has a finite life based on the period during which the entity would be expected to hold it (considering legal, contractual, and economic factors). The useful life may be shorter than the legal life. The asset is amortized over this period. Impairment testing under ASC 360 applies.',

The ROU asset generally equals the lease liability, ADJUSTED for any favorable or unfavorable terms compared to market rates. For example, if the acquiree\'s lease has below-market rents, the ROU asset will exceed the liability (intangible asset — favorable lease).
