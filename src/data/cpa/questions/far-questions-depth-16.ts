      'Identify the contract with a customer',
      'Identify the performance obligations in the contract',
      'Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The five-step model under ASC 606 is: (1) Identify the contract with a customer, (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) Determine the transaction price, (4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The process starts with identifying a valid contract that meets the criteria in ASC 606-10-25-1.',

    question: 'Which of the following is NOT one of the criteria required for a contract to exist under ASC 606?',
    options: [
      'The parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their obligations',
      'Each party\'s rights regarding goods or services to be transferred can be identified',
      'The contract must be in writing and signed by both parties',
      'It is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'ASC 606-10-25-1 requires five criteria for a contract: (a) approved by parties with commitment, (b) identifiable rights, (c) identifiable payment terms, (d) commercial substance, and (e) probable collection. A written contract is NOT required — oral and implied contracts can meet the definition. The key is that all five criteria are met, and the contract creates enforceable rights and obligations.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-25-27, a performance obligation is satisfied over time if one of three criteria is met. Here, criterion (c) applies: the entity\'s performance creates or enhances an asset (the building) that the customer controls as it is created — since it\'s being built on the customer\'s land, the customer controls it throughout construction. Revenue is recognized over time using a measure of progress (typically input or output method).',

      '$0, until the return period expires',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-32-7, variable consideration (including the right of return) is estimated using the expected value or most likely amount method, subject to the constraint. The entity recognizes revenue only for the amount to which it expects to be entitled — $95,000 (950 units × $100). A refund liability of $5,000 is recorded for the expected returns, and an asset is recorded for the right to recover the products from customers.

    question: 'An entity has an existing contract to provide 100 units at $10 each. After delivering 60 units, the contract is modified to add 20 units at $8 each (a standalone selling price of $9.50). The modification should be:',

      'Ignored because the units are already partially delivered',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-25-12, a contract modification is treated as a separate contract if: (a) the additional goods are distinct, AND (b) the price reflects standalone selling prices. Here, the additional units are at $8, not the standalone price of $9.50, so criterion (b) fails. Since the modification cannot be treated as a separate contract and the remaining goods are distinct from those already transferred, the modification is accounted for prospectively — as a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract that includes the remaining 40 + 20 units.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-55-36 through 40, an entity is a principal if it controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. An agent arranges for the principal to provide the good or service. Indicators of agent status include: the entity does not obtain control of goods before transfer, cannot direct use of goods, and bears no inventory risk. A marketplace that merely facilitates transactions, bears no inventory risk, and has merchants set prices acts as an agent and recognizes only the net commission as revenue.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 340-40-25-1, incremental costs of obtaining a contract (costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained, such as sales commissions) are recognized as an asset if the entity expects to recover them. The asset is amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL) model under ASC 326-20 requires entities to measure expected credit losses over the contractual life of financial assets at the reporting date, based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Unlike the prior "incurred loss" model, CECL is forward-looking and requires recognition of expected losses from Day 1, even before a loss event has occurred. For trade receivables, entities may use a practical expedient (aging schedule, loss-rate method, or roll-rate method).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 326-20-30-2, when a financial asset is individually evaluated, the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis ($200,000) and the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan\'s effective interest rate ($138,889). The impairment loss = $200,000 – $138,889 = $61,111. This amount is recorded through the allowance for credit losses account.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Pledging receivables as collateral for a loan is NOT a transfer of financial assets. The receivables remain on the borrower\'s balance sheet because the borrower retains control.

NRV is defined as estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The previous "lower of cost or market" rule (with ceiling/floor tests using NRV and NRV minus normal profit) still applies ONLY to inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method.',

    explanation: 'The conventional retail method (also called the lower of cost or market retail method) excludes net markdowns from the denominator when calculating the cost-to-retail ratio. By excluding markdowns from the retail column, the denominator is larger, resulting in a lower cost-to-retail percentage. When this lower percentage is applied to ending inventory at retail, it produces a lower inventory value — approximating lower of cost or market. If markdowns were included, the ratio would be higher (the average cost method), and the result would be closer to average cost.',

      'Using the pre-modification effective interest rate to discount expected cash flows',

      'At fair value through profit or loss',
      'The TDR model still applies',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2022-02 (effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, for PBEs) eliminated the TDR accounting model for creditors. Instead of applying separate TDR measurement guidance, creditors evaluate all loan modifications under the general CECL framework (ASC 326). Enhanced disclosures are required for modifications (including principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, payment deferrals, and term extensions) to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The separate recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs was eliminated.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 330-10-35-17, when a firm, noncancelable purchase commitment exists and the market price of the goods has declined below the commitment price, the loss should be recognized in the current period. The expected loss of $30,000 (10,000 units × ($15 – $12)) is recorded as a debit to Loss on Purchase Commitment and a credit to Estimated Liability on Purchase Commitment. When the goods are eventually received, they are recorded at the lower market price ($12), with the liability being offset.',

An extended warranty or one that provides a service beyond fixing defects that existed at the time of sale is a service-type warranty.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-55-58 through 62, licenses of intellectual property are classified as either: (1) a right to ACCESS the IP (recognized over time), or (2) a right to USE the IP (recognized at a point in time).
