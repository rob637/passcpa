    options: [
      'Total interest incurred during the period',

      'Prime rate times the average accumulated expenditures',
      'Interest on specific borrowings only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 835-20-30-2, the amount of interest to be capitalized is the avoidable interest — a measure of the interest cost incurred during the period that theoretically could have been avoided if the qualifying asset had not been under construction. It is computed by applying the interest rate(s) to the average accumulated expenditures for the asset during the period. The rate on specific borrowings is used first, then a weighted-average rate on other borrowings. Capitalized interest cannot exceed total interest incurred during the period.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 410-20-25-4 requires an ARO to be recognized at fair value when a legal obligation is incurred, if fair value can be reasonably estimated. Fair value is typically calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. The corresponding amount is added to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life. The ARO liability is accreted (increased) each period using the same discount rate, with the accretion recognized as an operating expense.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 360-10-35-17, the recoverability test (Step 1) compares the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from its use and eventual disposition. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is not recoverable and an impairment loss is measured (Step 2) as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.

Since the exchange has commercial substance (under ASC 845-10-30-1), the gain is recognized in full. The new machine is recorded at its fair value of $45,000. If the exchange lacked commercial substance, the new asset would generally be recorded at the book value of the old asset minus cash received ($40,000 – $5,000 = $35,000), with limited or no gain recognition.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'ASU 2017-04 eliminated the former Step 2 (implied fair value of goodwill calculation). Under the simplified test, an entity compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount (including goodwill). If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This one-step test is simpler and less costly than the former two-step test. An optional qualitative assessment (Step 0) can still be performed first.',

Instead, they are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The impairment test compares the fair value of the intangible to its carrying amount — any excess of carrying amount over fair value is recognized as an impairment loss.

Investment income = 30% × $200,000 = $60,000. Dividend reduction = 30% × $50,000 = $15,000. Ending balance = $500,000 + $60,000 – $15,000 = $545,000. Under the equity method, dividends are not income — they reduce the carrying value of the investment. This differs from fair value accounting where dividends are recognized as income.',

This eliminated the former "available-for-sale" classification for equity securities where unrealized gains/losses went to OCI. The OCI treatment now applies only to debt securities classified as available-for-sale.

Unrealized holding gains and losses on AFS debt securities are excluded from net income and reported in other comprehensive income (OCI) as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in equity. When the security is sold, the cumulative unrealized gain/loss is reclassified from AOCI to net income (the "reclassification adjustment").

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 326-30 (CECL for AFS debt securities), the total unrealized loss ($15,000) is split between: (1) Credit-related loss = amortized cost minus PV of expected cash flows = $100,000 – $92,000 = $8,000, recognized through an allowance for credit losses (net income); and (2) Non-credit-related loss = $92,000 – $85,000 = $7,000, recognized in OCI.

Common examples: accelerated tax depreciation (tax depreciation > book depreciation now, reverses later), installment sales (book income now, taxable income later), and prepaid revenue (taxable now, book income later).

Realization depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income in future periods. Positive evidence (future income projections, taxable temporary differences, tax-planning strategies) is weighed against negative evidence (cumulative losses, history of unused tax benefits, uncertainty). A 3-year cumulative loss is significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome.',

When a new rate is enacted, all existing deferred tax balances must be remeasured at the new rate. The underlying temporary difference = $210,000 / 21% = $1,000,000. New DTL = $1,000,000 × 28% = $280,000. The $70,000 increase is recognized in income tax expense (or benefit) in the period the rate change is enacted, not when the temporary difference reverses.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 360-10-45-9, a long-lived asset classified as held for sale is: (1) measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, (2) no longer depreciated, and (3) reported separately in the balance sheet (not netted with other assets). The criteria for classification include: management commits to a plan to sell, the asset is available for immediate sale, an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, the sale is probable within one year, the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price, and it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 350-40-25 identifies three stages: (1) Preliminary project stage — costs are expensed (conceptual formulation, evaluation of alternatives, determining technology requirements); (2) Application development stage — costs are capitalized (design, coding, testing, installation); (3) Post-implementation/operation stage — costs are expensed (training, maintenance, minor upgrades). Data conversion costs are capitalized only to the extent necessary for the software to be placed in service. ASU 2018-15 extended this guidance to cloud computing arrangements (implementation costs of hosting arrangements).',

    question: 'An investor pays $600,000 for 40% of an investee with net assets of $1,200,000 at book value. The fair value of the investee\'s building (10-year remaining life) exceeds book value by $150,000. No other fair value adjustments exist. The annual amortization of the basis difference is:',

      '$0 — no amortization is required',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The cost of the investment ($600,000) exceeds 40% of book value (40% × $1,200,000 = $480,000) by $120,000. This excess is allocated to identifiable assets based on fair value differences: building excess = $150,000 × 40% = $60,000 (amortized over 10 years = $6,000/year). The remaining $60,000 ($120,000 – $60,000) is attributed to goodwill, which is NOT amortized under the equity method. Annual equity income is reduced by the $6,000 depreciation adjustment on the building difference. The investor reports income = share of investee income less $6,000.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Taxable income = $1,000,000 – $50,000 (permanent difference) = $950,000. Tax expense = $950,000 × 21% = $199,500. The effective tax rate = $199,500 / $1,000,000 (pre-tax book income) = 19.95%. The municipal bond interest is a permanent difference (never taxed) that reduces the effective rate below the statutory rate. The rate reconciliation would show: statutory rate (21%) – municipal bond exclusion (–1.05%) = effective rate (19.95%). Under ASC 740-10-50-12, public entities must provide a rate reconciliation in their disclosures.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2023-08 (effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, for PBEs) requires that crypto assets meeting certain criteria (fungible, not provided or created by the entity, secured through distributed ledger technology, not representing financial assets or equity) be measured at fair value each reporting period, with changes recognized in net income. This replaces the previous treatment of crypto assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets (cost minus impairment under ASC 350), which was widely criticized as not reflecting economic reality because it never allowed upward remeasurement.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IAS 20 (and the analog guidance that appears in CPA exam contexts), government grants related to assets may be presented using either: (1) the net method — reducing the carrying amount of the asset, which reduces depreciation expense over the asset\'s life; or (2) the gross method — recording the grant as deferred income and recognizing it in income systematically over the useful life of the asset. Under U.S. GAAP, ASC 958-605 provides analogous guidance for not-for-profit entities, and ASU 2021-10 enhanced disclosures for government assistance received by business entities.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) eliminated the 2-year carryback for most NOLs (with limited exceptions for farming and insurance companies) and allowed indefinite carryforward. However, NOL deductions are limited to 80% of taxable income (computed without the NOL deduction) for losses arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The CARES Act temporarily allowed 5-year carryback for NOLs arising in 2018-2020 and suspended the 80% limitation for those years. For purposes of ASC 740, the deferred tax asset for NOL carryforwards is measured at the enacted rate and subject to a valuation allowance if appropriate.',
