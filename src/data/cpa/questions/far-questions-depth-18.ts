      'Above face value because the stated rate exceeds the market rate',
      'Below face value because the market rate exceeds the stated rate',
      'Equal to face value',
      'Below face value because the stated rate exceeds the market rate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A bond is issued at a discount when the market (effective) interest rate exceeds the bond\'s stated (coupon) rate. Investors demand a higher yield, so they pay less than face value. The discount is the difference between face value and issue price. Under ASC 835-30, the discount is amortized over the bond\'s life using the effective interest method (preferred) or straight-line method (if the results are not materially different), increasing interest expense each period above the cash coupon payment.',

    question: 'A $1,000,000 face value bond with a 6% stated rate is issued at $951,963 when the market rate is 7%. Interest is paid annually. Under the effective interest method, the interest expense for Year 1 is:',

      '$70,000',
      '$57,118',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the effective interest method, interest expense = carrying amount × market rate. Year 1 interest expense = $951,963 × 7% = $66,637. The cash paid = $1,000,000 × 6% = $60,000. The difference ($6,637) is the discount amortization, increasing the carrying amount to $958,600 ($951,963 + $6,637). Each year, as the carrying amount increases, interest expense increases as well under this method, unlike straight-line which allocates the discount equally.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2015-03 simplified the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring them to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, rather than as a separate asset (deferred charge). This approach is consistent with how bond discounts and premiums are presented. The costs are still amortized over the life of the debt using the effective interest method. An exception exists for line-of-credit arrangements, where issuance costs may still be presented as an asset.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2020-06 (effective for PBEs for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021) simplified convertible instrument accounting by eliminating the beneficial conversion feature (BCF) and cash conversion models that previously required separation of debt and equity components. Under the revised guidance, most convertible instruments are accounted for as a single liability unless: (1) the conversion feature must be bifurcated as a derivative under ASC 815, or (2) the instrument is issued with a substantial premium. This reduces complexity and makes interest expense more comparable across entities.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the cost method (ASC 505-30-30-7), treasury stock is recorded at the reacquisition cost (the price paid to buy back the shares). It is presented as a contra-equity account, reducing total stockholders\' equity. When treasury stock is later reissued above cost, the excess goes to additional paid-in capital from treasury stock transactions. If reissued below cost, the deficit reduces APIC from treasury stock (then retained earnings if APIC is insufficient). The par value method, by contrast, debits treasury stock at par value and adjusts APIC.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'In a stock split, the number of shares outstanding increases and the par value per share decreases proportionally, with no change in total par value, APIC, retained earnings, or total equity. A 2-for-1 split doubles the shares and halves the par value. Only a memorandum entry is needed to note the change. This differs from a stock dividend, which does require a journal entry (transferring amounts from retained earnings to common stock and APIC). A reverse stock split reduces shares and increases par value.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Cumulative preferred stock requires that any unpaid dividends from prior years (dividends in arrears) must be paid before any dividends can be distributed to common stockholders. Dividends in arrears are not a liability until declared by the board but must be disclosed in the financial statement notes (ASC 505-10-50-5). Non-cumulative preferred stock, by contrast, does not accumulate unpaid dividends — if the board does not declare a dividend in a given year, the preferred stockholders lose the right to that year\'s dividend.',

Year 1 expense = $300,000 / 3 = $100,000. The entry is: Debit Compensation Expense $100,000, Credit APIC — Stock Compensation $100,000. Upon vesting, the APIC account is reclassified.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 718-10-30-2 requires that employee stock options be measured at fair value on the grant date. Fair value is typically estimated using an option pricing model such as the Black-Scholes-Merton model or a lattice model (binomial), incorporating factors such as exercise price, expected term, current stock price, expected volatility, expected dividends, and risk-free interest rate. The fair value is not subsequently remeasured for equity-classified awards.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 420-10-25-4, a liability for one-time employee termination benefits is recognized when: (1) management with the appropriate level of authority commits to a plan of termination, (2) the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their locations, job classifications, and expected completion date, (3) the plan establishes the benefits in enough detail to enable affected employees to determine the type and amount of benefits, and (4) the plan is unlikely to be significantly changed or withdrawn. The liability is measured at fair value on the communication date.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASU 2016-01 (ASC 825-10-45-5), when the fair value option is elected for a financial liability, changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk are presented in OCI, not net income. All other changes in fair value (e.g., due to changes in market interest rates) are recognized in net income. This prevents the counterintuitive result where a company\'s deteriorating creditworthiness would result in gains on its own debt in net income. The amounts in OCI are not reclassified to net income upon derecognition.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 410-20-35-3, the ARO liability increases each period through accretion, which is the passage of time increasing the present value of the obligation. Accretion expense for Year 1 = beginning ARO balance × original discount rate = $100,000 × 6% = $6,000. The entry is: Debit Accretion Expense $6,000, Credit ARO Liability $6,000. The ARO liability at the end of Year 1 is $106,000. Accretion expense is classified as an operating expense (similar in nature to interest expense). Over the asset\'s life, the ARO accretes to the expected settlement amount.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 718-10-35-3, for awards with performance conditions, compensation cost is recognized when it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved. Since management determines at the end of Year 1 that achievement is probable, total compensation = 5,000 × $20 = $100,000, recognized over the 3-year service period. Year 1 expense = $100,000 / 3 = $33,333. If in a subsequent period it becomes improbable, previously recognized expense is reversed. The fair value is NOT adjusted for performance conditions — only the number of awards expected to vest is affected.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 710-10-25-1 requires accrual of a liability for compensated absences when all four conditions are met: (1) the employer\'s obligation relates to employee services already rendered, (2) the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate, (3) payment is probable, and (4) the amount can be reasonably estimated. Vacation pay that vests or accumulates is almost always accrued. Sick pay is usually accrued only if it vests (is paid upon termination) — if sick pay only accumulates but does not vest, accrual is encouraged but not required.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 260-10-45-10, basic EPS is calculated as: (Net income – Preferred dividends) / Weighted-average common shares outstanding. Basic EPS = ($500,000 – $50,000) / 200,000 = $2.25. Preferred dividends are subtracted from net income because basic EPS measures income available to common shareholders. For cumulative preferred stock, the preferred dividend is subtracted regardless of whether declared. For non-cumulative preferred, only declared dividends are subtracted.',
