    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Current financial resources measurement focus (governmental funds): The balance sheet reports only resources that are available for spending: cash, receivables, short-term investments, and current liabilities payable from those resources. Capital assets and long-term liabilities do NOT appear on governmental fund financial statements. Instead: capital asset purchases are recorded as expenditures, bond proceeds are recorded as "other financing sources," and debt principal payments are recorded as expenditures. These items DO appear on the government-wide financial statements (full accrual). The reconciliation schedule bridges fund balance sheet to government-wide Statement of Net Position.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'GASB 54 fund balance classifications: (1) Nonspendable — not in spendable form (inventory, prepaid) or legally/contractually required to remain intact (endowment corpus). (2) Restricted — constraints imposed by external parties (creditors, grantors, laws). (3) Committed — constraints imposed by the government\'s highest decision-making authority (council resolution) — requires formal action to set AND remove. (4) Assigned — intended use designated by authorized body/official — less formal than committed. (5) Unassigned — residual amount in General Fund only (other governmental funds cannot have positive unassigned fund balance). When spending from restricted AND unrestricted: restricted first.

Charity care: patients who qualify for free/reduced care under the entity\'s charity care policy. Charity care is NOT recognized as revenue at all. It is NOT a deduction from revenue. Instead: disclosed in the notes (description of policy, level of charity care provided — quantified by charges forgone, estimated costs, or other measure).

    explanation: 'GASB 34 — Modified approach for infrastructure: An alternative to depreciation for eligible infrastructure that is part of a network or subsystem. Requirements: (1) Government must maintain an asset management system with an up-to-date inventory and perform condition assessments at least every three years using a measurement scale. (2) Government must have documentation that the assets are being preserved at or above the condition level established. If requirements are met: no depreciation is recognized. Preservation/maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Additions and improvements ARE capitalized. If the government fails to meet the requirements: must switch back to depreciation.

Purpose: account for resources legally restricted or committed to specific purposes (other than debt service or capital projects). Examples: motor fuel tax fund (gas taxes restricted for road maintenance), federal grant funds, hotel/motel tax fund (tourism). Key points: must have a substantial portion of inflows from restricted or committed revenue sources.
