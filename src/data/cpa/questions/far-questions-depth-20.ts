    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 805-10-05-4 requires ALL business combinations to be accounted for using the acquisition method. The pooling-of-interests method was eliminated by SFAS 141 (now codified in ASC 805). The acquisition method requires: (1) identifying the acquirer, (2) determining the acquisition date, (3) recognizing and measuring identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value, and (4) recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'ASC 805-10-25-23 requires acquisition-related costs to be expensed as incurred, with the exception of costs to issue debt or equity securities, which are accounted for under ASC 470 and ASC 505 respectively. This includes advisory, legal, accounting, valuation, and other professional fees.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-30-30-1, goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (both measured at fair value). Goodwill = $5,000,000 (consideration) – $4,200,000 (fair value of identifiable net assets) = $800,000.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-30-25-2, if the consideration transferred is less than the fair value of identifiable net assets (a bargain purchase), the acquirer must first reassess whether all assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been correctly identified and measured. After reassessment, if the excess remains, the acquirer recognizes a gain on bargain purchase in net income in the period of acquisition. Negative goodwill is not recognized as a liability. The gain = $3,500,000 – $3,000,000 = $500,000.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-30-25-5, contingent consideration is recognized at its acquisition-date fair value as part of the consideration transferred. Subsequent accounting depends on classification: if classified as a liability (or asset), it is remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes recognized in earnings (not adjusted against goodwill). If classified as equity, it is not remeasured — settlement is accounted for within equity. Classification depends on the terms of the arrangement and guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815.

It is treated as an indefinite-lived intangible asset (not amortized but tested for impairment) until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon completion, it becomes a finite-lived intangible and is amortized over its useful life. If abandoned, the carrying amount is written off. This differs from internally developed R&D, which is generally expensed as incurred under ASC 730.',

Net income attributable to the NCI must also be presented on the face of the consolidated income statement.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-20-30-1, when the acquirer elects to measure NCI at fair value (full goodwill method): Goodwill = (Consideration + NCI at fair value) – Fair value of identifiable net assets = ($4,000,000 + $1,100,000) – $4,500,000 = $600,000. The full goodwill method attributes goodwill to both the controlling and noncontrolling interests. If the proportionate share method were used instead, NCI would be measured at its proportionate share of net assets ($4,500,000 × 20% = $900,000), and goodwill would be $400,000 ($4,000,000 + $900,000 – $4,500,000).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The gross profit percentage on the intercompany sale is ($100,000 – $70,000) / $100,000 = 30%. Of the transferred inventory, $40,000 remains unsold at year-end. Unrealized profit = $40,000 × 30% = $12,000. This $12,000 must be eliminated in consolidation because from the consolidated entity\'s perspective, the inventory cost is $28,000 (= $40,000 – $12,000), not $40,000. Since this is a downstream sale (parent → subsidiary), 100% of the unrealized profit is eliminated against the parent\'s interest. For upstream sales (sub → parent), 100% is still eliminated, but the NCI allocation is affected.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-10-25-10, in a step acquisition (business combination achieved in stages), the acquirer remeasures its previously held equity interest at acquisition-date fair value and recognizes any resulting gain or loss in net income. The total consideration for goodwill calculation includes both the cash paid for the additional 40% AND the fair value of the previously held 30% interest. This effectively treats the transaction as if the acquirer disposed of the old investment and acquired 70% at fair value, ensuring that 100% of identifiable net assets are measured at acquisition-date fair value.',

No gain or loss is recognized in net income. The carrying amount of the NCI is adjusted to reflect the change in ownership, and any difference between the consideration paid and the amount by which NCI is adjusted is recognized in the parent\'s equity (typically additional paid-in capital).

From the consolidated entity\'s perspective, the equipment should be at its original cost basis of $200,000 with depreciation of $25,000/year ($200,000 ÷ 8). Elimination entries: (1) Eliminate the $80,000 unrealized gain from the intercompany sale; (2) Reduce accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense by $10,000 ($35,000 – $25,000) — this recognizes that the unrealized profit is being realized through depreciation. Each year, $10,000 of the unrealized profit is realized, and after 8 years, the full $80,000 will be realized.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-10-25-20 through 23, if a preexisting relationship between the acquirer and acquiree is effectively settled as a result of the business combination, it is accounted for separately from the business combination. The acquirer recognizes a gain or loss on settlement in income, measured as the lesser of: (a) the amount by which the contract is favorable or unfavorable from the acquirer\'s perspective relative to market terms, or (b) any settlement provision in the contract. This ensures that the business combination consideration reflects only the value of the business acquired, not the resolution of prior obligations.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 805-50 (as amended by ASU 2014-17) allows an acquired entity to elect push-down accounting when a change-in-control event occurs. Push-down accounting adjusts the acquired entity\'s separate financial statements to reflect the new basis arising from the parent\'s acquisition (fair value of assets and liabilities, goodwill). The election can be made at the time of the change-in-control event or any subsequent change-in-control event. The election is irrevocable once made. If not elected, the subsidiary continues to report on its historical cost basis in its separate financial statements.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 810-10-45-19, net income (loss) is attributed to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest based on their respective ownership percentages. The NCI owns 25% of Sub Corp, so the NCI share of Sub\'s net income = $400,000 × 25% = $100,000. This is presented on the face of the consolidated income statement separately from net income attributable to the parent. Consolidated net income = $400,000 (includes 100% of Sub\'s results), with $300,000 attributable to Parent and $100,000 attributable to NCI.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-20-25-17, the acquirer does NOT recognize a liability for restructuring or exit activities that the acquirer plans to undertake as part of or following the business combination. Only liabilities that the acquiree had already recognized under ASC 420 (exit or disposal cost obligations) at the acquisition date are recognized in the acquisition accounting. The acquirer\'s own restructuring plans (employee terminations, facility closures relating to the acquirer\'s operations) are recognized as expenses in post-acquisition periods when the criteria of ASC 420 are met.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 323-10-15-6, an investor that has significant influence over an investee (generally presumed at 20-50% ownership of voting stock) but does not have control uses the equity method. The investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for the investor\'s share of the investee\'s net income (loss) and reduced by dividends received. If the investor has control (typically >50%), full consolidation is required under ASC 810. Below 20% with no significant influence, the investment is measured at fair value (FVTNI for equity securities, per ASC 321) or, if no readily determinable fair value, at cost minus impairment, adjusted for observable price changes.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When a subsidiary acquires bonds of its parent on the open market (constructive retirement), the intercompany bond holdings must be eliminated in consolidation. The parent\'s bond payable (at carrying amount including unamortized premium/discount and issuance costs) and the subsidiary\'s bond investment (at carrying amount) are offset. Any difference between these two carrying amounts represents a constructive gain or loss recognized in consolidated income in the year of the constructive retirement. In subsequent years, the gain/loss is allocated between the parent and subsidiary as their respective carrying amounts converge to face value through amortization.',
