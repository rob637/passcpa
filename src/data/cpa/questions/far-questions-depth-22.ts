      'Par value of the shares',
      'Book value of the shares at vesting',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 718-10-30-2 requires all share-based payment awards (stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, SARs) to be measured at fair value at the grant date. For stock options, fair value is typically estimated using an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes or lattice model). For restricted stock and RSUs, fair value is generally the stock price at the grant date (adjusted for any market conditions). The fair value determined at grant date is not subsequently remeasured for equity-classified awards — it is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period.',

    explanation: 'Total compensation cost = 10,000 options × $8 = $80,000. Under ASC 718-10-35-3, this cost is recognized over the requisite service period (vesting period) on a straight-line basis for awards with only a service condition and cliff vesting, or on a straight-line basis for each separately vesting tranche (accelerated recognition) for graded vesting awards. For a 4-year cliff vesting: $80,000 ÷ 4 years = $20,000 per year. The entry each year: Dr. Compensation Expense $20,000, Cr. Additional Paid-in Capital (equity) $20,000.',

    options: [
      'Fair value is adjusted for the probability of achieving the performance condition at the grant date',

      'No compensation expense is recognized until the performance target is achieved',
      'Expense is recognized at the maximum possible amount',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 718-10-30-27, performance conditions are NOT reflected in the grant-date fair value measurement. Instead, the number of awards expected to vest is assessed at each reporting period based on the probability of achieving the performance condition. If it is probable the condition will be met, compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period based on the number of instruments expected to vest. If the probability assessment changes, a cumulative catch-up adjustment is recorded. This contrasts with market conditions (e.g., stock price targets), which ARE reflected in the grant-date fair value and the cost is recognized regardless of whether the market condition is achieved.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASU 2016-09 (codified in ASC 718-10-35-3) simplified forfeiture accounting by providing an accounting policy election: entities may either (1) estimate forfeitures at the grant date and revise the estimate as actual forfeitures differ (the traditional approach), or (2) account for forfeitures when they occur (recognize expense based on all outstanding awards and reverse previously recognized expense when a forfeiture occurs). The election is made on an entity-wide basis and requires a modified retrospective transition. Most private companies prefer the actual forfeiture method due to its simplicity.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 718-10-25-11, awards that obligate the entity to settle in cash or other assets (rather than issuing shares) are classified as liabilities. Liability-classified awards are initially measured at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date until settlement. Changes in fair value are recognized as compensation cost. This differs from equity-classified awards, which are measured at grant-date fair value with no subsequent remeasurement. Cash-settled stock appreciation rights (SARs), phantom stock plans, and awards with cash settlement features are common examples of liability-classified awards.',

The weighted average considers shares issued and repurchased during the period, weighted by the fraction of the period they were outstanding.

The numerator (income available to common shareholders) is adjusted by adding back the after-tax interest expense associated with the convertible bonds (since if converted, interest would not be paid). The denominator is increased by the number of common shares that would be issued upon conversion.

The entity must assess each security independently. For options and warrants: they are antidilutive when the exercise price exceeds the average market price (out of the money). For convertible securities: they are antidilutive when adding back interest (after tax) to the numerator and adding conversion shares to the denominator would increase EPS.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 250-10-45-5 requires a voluntary change in accounting principle to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented, unless it is impracticable to do so. Retrospective application means adjusting the opening balance of retained earnings of the earliest period presented for the cumulative effect, and restating all periods as if the new principle had always been in use.

Prior periods are NOT restated. For example, if the useful life of an asset is changed from 10 years to 8 years after 4 years of use, the remaining book value is depreciated over the revised remaining life (4 years instead of 6).

It is accounted for prospectively — the new depreciation method is applied to the current carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life. Prior periods are not restated.

If the modification decreases fair value, the original cost continues to be recognized — you do not reduce previously recognized expense below the original grant-date fair value.',

      'Always included in diluted EPS from the date the contingency arises',

      'Excluded until the contingency is resolved',
      'Included at 50% probability',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 260-10-45-48 through 53, contingently issuable shares are treated differently for basic and diluted EPS. For basic EPS: included only when all necessary conditions are satisfied (the shares are no longer contingent). For diluted EPS: included if the conditions would be satisfied as of the end of the reporting period, assuming the end of the period were the end of the contingency period. If the contingency depends on earnings, current-period earnings are used to determine if the condition is met. If based on a market price, the current-period market price is used. This ensures diluted EPS reflects potential dilution.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 250-10-45-9 provides relief when retrospective application is impracticable. Impracticability exists when the entity cannot determine the cumulative effect (e.g., information is not available and cannot reasonably be obtained). In such cases, the entity applies the new principle prospectively from the earliest date practicable. The entity must demonstrate why retrospective application is impracticable and disclose the alternative approach used. This exception is narrowly interpreted — significant effort must be made before concluding that retrospective application is impracticable.',

      'The plan does not include option features beyond a reasonable purchase period',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 718-50-25-1, an ESPP is noncompensatory if: (1) the plan does not incorporate option features other than allowing employees a short period to enroll after the price is fixed (generally up to 31 days); (2) the discount from market price does not exceed 5% per share; (3) substantially all full-time employees may participate (excluding employees with less than 2 years of service, part-time/seasonal employees, and highly compensated employees). A 20% discount would make the plan compensatory, requiring compensation expense recognition. Most Section 423 ESPPs exceed the 5% discount threshold and are therefore compensatory under ASC 718.',

Both basic and diluted EPS must be presented on the face of the income statement for: (1) income from continuing operations, and (2) net income.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A modified retrospective transition method requires the entity to recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other applicable equity component) in the period of adoption. Prior periods are NOT restated — they continue to be reported under the previous guidance. However, the entity typically provides additional disclosures comparing current-period results under the new standard with what would have been reported under the old standard.

    explanation: 'ASU 2016-09 simplified the accounting for stock compensation tax effects by requiring ALL excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recognized in the income statement as part of income tax expense (benefit) in the period the awards vest or are exercised. Previously, excess benefits were recognized in APIC and deficiencies were recognized in APIC (to the extent of the cumulative APIC pool). The simplification means that: (1) no APIC pool tracking is needed; (2) tax effects flow through earnings, which may increase earnings volatility; (3) excess tax benefits are classified as operating cash flows (previously financing).',
