      '6 months from the balance sheet date',
      '1 year after the date the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued)',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 205-40-50-1 requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity\'s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued for non-SEC filers). This evaluation must occur each annual and interim reporting period. If substantial doubt exists, management must also evaluate whether its plans to mitigate the conditions will alleviate the doubt.',

      'No disclosure is required',
      'The entity discloses the conditions giving rise to the doubt and management\'s plans, but states that substantial doubt has been alleviated',
      'The entity must issue going concern financial statements',
      'The entity must immediately liquidate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 205-40-50-12 through 13 provides a two-level disclosure framework: (1) If substantial doubt is raised but management\'s plans are probable of mitigating the doubt, the entity discloses the principal conditions/events and management\'s plans, but it is NOT required to include "substantial doubt" language. (2) If substantial doubt is NOT alleviated by management\'s plans, the entity must include an explicit statement that substantial doubt exists, along with the conditions and management\'s plans. Both scenarios require footnote disclosure; the distinction is whether "substantial doubt" language must be used.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 205-40-50-1, conditions and events that raise substantial doubt include: recurring operating losses, negative working capital, working capital deficiencies, negative cash flows from operations, default on loan covenants, denial of trade credit from suppliers, pending litigation with potentially adverse outcomes, and upcoming debt maturities without available refinancing. A combination of these factors — especially recurring losses, negative operating cash flows, and impending debt maturities — strongly suggests the entity may not be able to meet its obligations. A stock price decline or CEO change, while concerning, do not alone indicate inability to continue operations.',

    explanation: 'ASU 2014-08 raised the threshold for reporting discontinued operations. Under ASC 205-20-45-1B, a disposal (or component held for sale or abandoned) is reported as a discontinued operation ONLY if it represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the entity\'s operations and financial results. Examples include disposing of a major geographical area of operations, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other disposals meeting the strategic shift criteria.

The discontinued operations section is reported net of tax as a single line item (or with separate lines for operating results and disposal gain/loss).

If fair value less costs to sell is lower, an impairment loss is recognized. The asset is no longer depreciated while classified as held for sale. Criteria for held-for-sale classification include: management commits to a plan to sell, the asset is available for immediate sale, an active program to locate a buyer is initiated, the sale is probable within one year, the asset is being actively marketed at a reasonable price, and it is unlikely the plan will change significantly.',

The entity should not make claims about arm\'s-length terms unless it can demonstrate through market comparisons, independent appraisals, or other evidence that the terms are indeed equivalent. This is important because related party transactions are inherently subject to manipulation, and unsupported claims about arm\'s-length pricing could mislead financial statement users.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 845-10-30-1, a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the entity\'s future cash flows are expected to change significantly as a result of the transaction. Specifically, commercial substance exists if: (1) the configuration (risk, timing, amount) of the future cash flows of the asset received differs significantly from the asset given up, OR (2) the entity-specific value of the assets differs and the difference is significant relative to the fair values. If an exchange has commercial substance, both assets are measured at fair value and a gain or loss is recognized. If it lacks commercial substance, the asset received is generally measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up (no gain recognized).',

      'A loss of $5,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Since the exchange has commercial substance, the assets are measured at fair value. Company A gives up a machine worth $75,000 (FV) and receives a truck worth $70,000 plus $5,000 cash = $75,000 total. Gain = Fair value of assets received ($70,000 truck + $5,000 cash = $75,000) – Carrying value of asset given up ($50,000) = $25,000 gain. The truck is recorded at its fair value of $70,000 on Company A\'s books. Under ASC 845, when an exchange has commercial substance, the full gain is recognized at the time of the exchange.',

      '$27,000 (carrying value of old van minus cash received)',
      '$37,000',
      '$30,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When an exchange lacks commercial substance, the asset received is generally measured at the carrying amount of the asset given up, adjusted for any cash received. However, a gain may be partially recognized when cash (boot) is received. The boot percentage = $3,000 / ($37,000 + $3,000) = 7.5% — which is below the 25% threshold where the entire transaction would be treated as monetary. When boot received is less than 25%, a proportional gain is recognized: Recognized gain = $10,000 total gain × 7.5% = $750. The new van is recorded at: $30,000 (CV of old van) – $3,000 (cash received) + $750 (recognized gain) = $27,750. However, the simplified approach under ASC 845 for less than 25% boot records the asset at carrying value minus boot received = $30,000 – $3,000 = $27,000.',

    explanation: 'A quasi-reorganization (also called corporate readjustment under ASC 852) allows an entity to obtain a "fresh start" without formal bankruptcy proceedings. The entity: (1) revalues assets and liabilities to fair value (writing down overvalued assets, recognizing unrecorded liabilities); (2) eliminates the retained earnings deficit by reclassifying it to additional paid-in capital (APIC reduced or par value adjusted); (3) dates retained earnings from the quasi-reorganization date ("retained earnings since [date]") for at least 3 years.

    options: [
      'Only customer concentrations',
      'Concentrations in revenue from a few customers, reliance on key suppliers, geographic concentration, labor force concentration, and concentration of credit risk',
      'Only geographic concentrations',
      'Only financial instrument concentrations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 275-10-50-16 through 21 requires disclosure of concentrations that make the entity vulnerable to a near-term severe impact. Types of concentrations include: (1) volume of business with a particular customer (major customer disclosure also required under ASC 280 if revenue from a single customer is 10% or more of total revenue); (2) revenue from a particular product or service; (3) available sources of supply (key supplier risk); (4) geographic concentration; (5) labor force (union dependency); and (6) concentration of credit risk. "Near-term" means within one year of the financial statement date; "severe impact" means significant financial impact.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 205-40-50-7 requires management to assess whether its plans to mitigate going concern conditions are (1) probable of being effectively implemented within one year after the date the financial statements are issued, and (2) when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions that raised substantial doubt. Plans involving obtaining financing, selling assets, or restructuring debt are conditional on factors potentially outside management\'s control. These plans are evaluated based on the probability of implementation — management must have a reasonable basis for concluding the plans will be executed successfully. Historical ability to obtain financing, existing term sheets, or committed credit facilities provide stronger evidence.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 845-10-30-4, if fair value is not determinable for either asset, the exchange is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up. No gain or loss is recognized because fair value cannot be used to measure the transaction. This is a fallback position — ASC 845 prioritizes fair value measurement but acknowledges that in rare cases, fair value may not be reasonably determinable. In practice, at least one side of the exchange usually has a determinable fair value, which is used to measure the transaction.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 205-20-45-3A, when a component is classified as a discontinued operation, the financial statements for all prior periods presented must be recast to separately present the results of the discontinued component — moving its revenue, expenses, and operating results from the continuing operations section to the discontinued operations section for each comparative period. This retroactive presentation ensures comparability — users can see what the continuing business generated across all periods. The balance sheet assets and liabilities of the component held for sale are presented separately only in the current period.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 805-50-30-5 requires transfers of businesses between entities under common control to be accounted for at the carrying amounts (historical cost) of the transferring entity. No gain or loss is recognized. Financial statements of the receiving entity are generally retrospectively adjusted to include the transferred entity for all periods during which the entities were under common control (as-if-pooling). This contrasts with business combinations involving unrelated parties, which use the acquisition method at fair value. The rationale is that transactions under common control do not represent arm\'s-length exchanges — the controlling party directs both sides of the transaction.',
