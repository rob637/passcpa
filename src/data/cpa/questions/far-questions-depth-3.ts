    explanation: 'ASC 230 (Statement of Cash Flows): Indirect method: starts with net income and adjusts for non-cash items and changes in working capital. Add back non-cash expenses: depreciation, amortization, impairment losses, deferred tax expense. Subtract non-cash revenues: gain on sale of assets (the cash from the sale is in investing). Working capital adjustments: increase in current assets → subtract (cash used); decrease in current assets → add (cash source); increase in current liabilities → add (cash source); decrease in current liabilities → subtract (cash used). Direct method: separately reports cash receipts from customers, cash paid to suppliers/employees, etc. FASB prefers direct method but allows either.',

NRV = estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business − reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Cost flow assumptions: FIFO (first-in, first-out), LIFO (last-in, first-out — U.S. GAAP only, not IFRS), weighted-average. Specific identification for unique items.

Applies to: loans, trade receivables, held-to-maturity securities, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet exposures.

Current process: (1) Optional qualitative assessment ("Step 0"): determine whether it is more likely than not (>50%) that the reporting unit FV < carrying amount. If not, no quantitative test needed. (2) Quantitative test: compare reporting unit FV to carrying amount (including goodwill). If FV < carrying amount: impairment loss = carrying amount − FV (capped at total goodwill).

    explanation: 'ASC 250 (Accounting Changes and Error Corrections): Change in accounting principle: retrospective application (restate prior periods). Cumulative effect of the change on periods before those presented: adjust beginning retained earnings of the earliest period shown. Justification: the new principle must be "preferable" — the entity must explain why. Exceptions (prospective): LIFO adoption (no restatement — base-year inventory = current carrying amount), changes required by new ASUs where the standard specifies prospective application. Change in accounting estimate: prospective only (current and future periods). Change in reporting entity: retrospective.

Subsequent adjustments: (1) Add: investor\'s share of investee\'s net income (Dr. Investment, Cr. Equity in earnings), (2) Subtract: dividends received (Dr. Cash, Cr. Investment — dividends reduce the investment, NOT revenue), (3) Amortize: excess cost over FV of net assets acquired (premium amortized as additional expense). Impairment: if decline is other-than-temporary, write down to fair value. < 20%: fair value (equity securities) or CECL/FV (debt). > 50%: consolidation (ASC 810).

Initial measurement: fair value (PV of expected cash flows using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate). Entry: Dr. Asset (increase carrying amount), Cr. ARO Liability. Subsequent measurement: (1) ARO liability: accrete using the original credit-adjusted risk-free rate (accretion expense — reported as operating expense), (2) Asset: depreciate the additional capitalized amount over the asset\'s useful life.

Three-level hierarchy: Level 1 (highest priority): quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical items — e.g., NYSE stock price. Level 2: observable inputs other than Level 1 — quoted prices for similar items, quoted prices in inactive markets, observable market data (interest rates, yield curves).

Methods: straight-line (most common), or a pattern that reflects the economic benefits consumed (e.g., units-of-production for mineral rights). Subject to impairment testing when events/circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable (ASC 360 — same as long-lived assets: undiscounted cash flow test → if impaired, write down to fair value). Patents: legal life = 20 years from filing. Copyrights: life of author + 70 years. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, technology: based on expected benefit period. Amortization typically recorded as operating expense.',

Step 1 (Recoverability test): Sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows from use and disposal. If undiscounted cash flows ≥ carrying amount: no impairment.

Result: most convertible debt is accounted for as a single liability at amortized cost (like regular debt). Interest expense = coupon interest + discount amortization. Reduces interest expense compared to old models (which allocated a higher rate to the debt component). Retained: embedded conversion features that are NOT clearly and closely related AND meet derivative scope exceptions are still separated.
