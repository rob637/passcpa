      'Identifying the contract with a customer',
      'Recognizing revenue when the performance obligation is satisfied',
      'Determining the transaction price',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The ASC 606 five-step model is: (1) Identify the contract with a customer, (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) Determine the transaction price, (4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. A valid contract requires: mutual approval, identifiable rights, payment terms, commercial substance, and probable collection of consideration.',

    question: 'A software company sells a software license, installation services, and 2 years of post-contract support (PCS) in a bundled arrangement. The installation requires significant customization. How many performance obligations exist?',
    options: [
      'One — everything is a single performance obligation',
      'Two — the combined software/installation is one, and the PCS is another',
      'Three — each element is a separate performance obligation',
      'Four — each year of PCS is separate',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-25-21, a promised good or service is a separate performance obligation if it is (a) capable of being distinct, and (b) distinct within the context of the contract. When installation involves significant customization of the software, the software license and installation are highly interdependent and not separately identifiable — they form a single combined performance obligation. The PCS is a separate performance obligation because it can be sold separately and does not significantly modify the software. Result: two performance obligations.',

    question: 'A company enters a contract with a $1,000,000 base price and a $200,000 performance bonus payable if the project is completed early. Management estimates a 70% probability of earning the bonus. The most likely amount method should be used. What transaction price should be recognized initially?',

      '$1,200,000 because the bonus is probable',
      '$1,140,000 (base + 70% of the bonus)',

      '$1,000,000 because the bonus is contingent and cannot be estimated',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-32-8, variable consideration is estimated using either the expected value method (probability-weighted) or the most likely amount method. The most likely amount method is appropriate when the outcome is binary (bonus earned or not). Since there is a 70% probability of earning the bonus, the most likely outcome is receiving the full $200,000 bonus. Therefore, the transaction price is $1,200,000 under the most likely amount method, subject to the constraint that it is probable a significant revenue reversal will not occur.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-20-30-1, the lessee initially measures the right-of-use (ROU) asset at the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus initial direct costs, minus any lease incentives received. The lease liability is the present value of lease payments: $50,000 × 4.46511 = $223,256. Since payments are at the beginning of each year (annuity due), the first payment reduces the liability immediately. The initial ROU asset equals $223,256 (assuming no initial direct costs or incentives).',

    question: 'A lessee has an operating lease with 3 years remaining and a lease liability of $120,000. The lease is modified to extend the term by 2 years with additional payments of $45,000 per year. The modification does not grant an additional right of use. How should the lessee account for this modification?',

      'Treat it as a new lease and derecognize the old lease',
      'Remeasure the lease liability using a revised discount rate and adjust the right-of-use asset by the same amount',
      'Record no adjustment until the extension period begins',
      'Expense the additional payments immediately',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-10-25-8 through 25-15, when a lease modification does not grant an additional right of use (or is not a separate contract), the lessee remeasures the lease liability at the modification date using a revised discount rate. The adjustment to the lease liability is recognized as a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 330-10-35-1B requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV). NRV is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This simplified approach (from ASU 2015-11) removed the previous requirement to compare cost to a "market" value determined as the middle of replacement cost, NRV, and NRV less normal profit margin. The LCNRV rule does not apply to LIFO or retail inventory methods.',

      '$950,000',
      '$1,100,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The LIFO reserve represents the difference between inventory valued at FIFO and inventory valued at LIFO. FIFO inventory = LIFO inventory + LIFO reserve. Therefore: $800,000 + $150,000 = $950,000. In periods of rising prices, LIFO inventory is lower than FIFO inventory because LIFO assigns the most recent (higher) costs to COGS. The LIFO reserve disclosure enables analysts to convert LIFO statements to a FIFO basis for comparability.',

    question: 'If ending inventory for Year 1 is overstated by $30,000, and no correction is made, what is the effect on Year 2 net income?',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Inventory errors have a counterbalancing effect over two periods. Year 1 ending inventory becomes Year 2 beginning inventory. If Year 1 ending inventory is overstated, COGS Year 1 is understated (net income overstated). In Year 2, the overstated beginning inventory causes COGS to be overstated, making Year 2 net income understated by the same $30,000. Over the two-year period, the errors offset.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 326-20 (CECL model) requires entities to measure expected credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost (including trade receivables) based on lifetime expected losses. The estimate should consider: (1) historical loss experience, (2) current conditions, and (3) reasonable and supportable forecasts. This forward-looking approach replaced the previous "incurred loss" model (which required a probable threshold before recognizing losses).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 860-10-40, a transfer of receivables qualifies as a sale when the transferor surrenders control. Without-recourse factoring typically qualifies because: (1) the assets are isolated from the transferor, (2) the factor can pledge or exchange the receivables, and (3) the transferor does not maintain effective control. The company debits Cash (proceeds), debits Loss on Sale (the difference), credits Accounts Receivable, and may credit Due from Factor for any holdback. With-recourse factoring may be treated as a secured borrowing if the seller retains substantially all risks.',

The corresponding amount is added to the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life: $1,884,450 ÷ 20 = $94,223/year additional depreciation.

The $30,000 discount is amortized over the life of the bonds, increasing the carrying amount toward face value at maturity. Under the effective interest method (ASC 835-30), interest expense = carrying amount × market rate, which exceeds the cash payment (face × stated rate = $25,000 semiannually).

    explanation: 'Under the cost method of accounting for treasury stock, the Treasury Stock account is debited at the cost (repurchase price) paid to reacquire the shares. Treasury stock is a contra-equity account that reduces total stockholders\' equity. When the shares are later reissued, any difference between the reissue price and the cost is adjusted through Additional Paid-in Capital from Treasury Stock (gains) or Retained Earnings (if APIC from treasury stock is exhausted for losses).',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 505-20, small stock dividends (less than 20-25% of outstanding shares) are recorded at the fair market value of the additional shares issued. Shares issued: 100,000 × 10% = 10,000 shares. FMV: 10,000 × $25 = $250,000. Entry: Dr Retained Earnings $250,000, Cr Common Stock (par) $10,000 (10,000 × $1), Cr APIC $240,000. Large stock dividends (25% or more) are recorded at par value only. The distinction reflects the assumption that small stock dividends do not significantly reduce the market price per share.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 715-30, net periodic pension cost includes components recognized in different locations. In net income: service cost (in operating expenses), interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and amortization of prior service cost and net actuarial gains/losses. In OCI: (1) actuarial gains and losses arising during the period (difference between actual and expected), (2) prior service cost from plan amendments, and (3) net gain/loss from settlements/curtailments.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When tax depreciation exceeds book depreciation, the tax basis of the asset is lower than the book basis, creating a taxable temporary difference. This will result in MORE taxable income in future periods when the book depreciation catches up and exceeds tax depreciation. A deferred tax liability (DTL) is recognized: ($150,000 - $100,000) × 21% = $10,500. DTLs represent future tax payments that will arise when the temporary difference reverses.

    explanation: 'Under ASC 740-10-30-5, a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not (>50% probability) that some or all of a DTA will not be realized. The allowance reduces the net DTA to the amount expected to be realized. If only $120,000 is expected to be realized, the valuation allowance = $200,000 - $120,000 = $80,000. Sources of taxable income to support realization include: (1) reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, (2) future taxable income exclusive of reversals, (3) taxable income in carryback years, and (4) tax-planning strategies.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 718, compensation cost for stock options is measured at the grant-date fair value and recognized over the requisite service period. Total compensation cost = 10,000 options × $8 × (1 - 5% estimated forfeitures) = 10,000 × $8 × 0.95 = $76,000. With 3-year cliff vesting and straight-line recognition: Year 1 expense = $76,000 ÷ 3 = $25,333. Under ASU 2016-09, entities may elect to recognize forfeitures as they occur instead of estimating them, but if estimates are used, they must be updated each period with a cumulative catch-up adjustment.',
