    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-10-05-4, all business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The pooling-of-interests method was eliminated by SFAS 141 (codified in ASC 805). The acquisition method requires: (1) identifying the acquirer, (2) determining the acquisition date, (3) recognizing and measuring the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest, and (4) recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase.',

    question: 'In a business combination, an acquirer pays $5,000,000 cash, issues stock with a fair value of $3,000,000, and agrees to contingent consideration with a fair value of $500,000 at the acquisition date. Direct acquisition costs are $200,000. What is the total acquisition-date consideration?',

      '$5,500,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-30-30-7, the consideration transferred in a business combination includes: (1) assets transferred (cash: $5,000,000), (2) equity interests issued ($3,000,000), and (3) contingent consideration at fair value ($500,000). Total = $8,500,000. Acquisition-related costs (legal, accounting, advisory fees) are NOT part of the consideration — they are expensed as incurred under ASC 805-10-25-23. This differs from asset acquisitions, where transaction costs are capitalized as part of the asset cost.',

    question: 'An acquirer pays $2,000,000 for a company whose identifiable net assets have a fair value of $2,500,000. After reassessing all valuations, the acquirer confirms the fair values. How is the $500,000 difference treated?',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-30-25-2, if the fair value of identifiable net assets exceeds the consideration transferred (a bargain purchase), the acquirer must first reassess to confirm all assets, liabilities, and fair values are correct. If the excess remains after reassessment, the acquirer recognizes a gain in net income in the period of acquisition. The gain is attributed to the acquirer (not the noncontrolling interest). Previously under APB 16, "negative goodwill" was allocated to reduce long-lived assets, but that approach was replaced by the bargain purchase gain model.',

Goodwill = Consideration ($10,000,000) - [Assets ($12,000,000) - Liabilities ($4,000,000)] = $10,000,000 - $8,000,000 = $2,000,000.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'In consolidation, intercompany transactions must be eliminated to avoid double-counting. The total intercompany profit is $200,000 - $150,000 = $50,000. However, only the UNREALIZED portion (still in Subsidiary\'s inventory) must be eliminated: 40% × $50,000 = $20,000. The remaining 60% ($30,000) has been realized through Subsidiary\'s sales to outside parties and is properly included in consolidated income. The elimination entry reduces consolidated COGS and ending inventory by $20,000. The full $200,000 intercompany sales/COGS are also eliminated.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 810-10-45-19, consolidated net income includes 100% of the subsidiary\'s results, with the noncontrolling interest\'s (NCI) share reported as a deduction. NCI share = 25% × $400,000 = $100,000. This amount is labeled "Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest" on the consolidated income statement. "Net income attributable to the parent" = $400,000 - $100,000 = $300,000.

    explanation: 'An entity is a VIE if any of three conditions exist: (1) The total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support (generally less than 10% of total assets). (2) The equity holders, as a group, lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity\'s economic performance. (3) The equity holders do not have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive expected residual returns. The primary beneficiary of a VIE must consolidate the entity.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 830-10-45-2 through 45-8, the functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates — typically the currency in which it generates and expends cash. Indicators include: (1) cash flow currency, (2) sales price currency, (3) sales market location, (4) expense currency, (5) financing currency, and (6) intercompany relationships. A foreign entity whose operations are an extension of the parent\'s operations (largely dollar-denominated) may have the U.S. dollar as its functional currency (remeasurement required rather than translation).',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 830 (current rate method for translation when functional currency ≠ reporting currency): Assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the exchange rates in effect when they were recognized (or a weighted-average rate as a practical expedient). Equity accounts are translated at historical rates. The resulting translation adjustment is reported in OCI (accumulated other comprehensive income).

At year end, the payable is remeasured at the current rate: $1.15 × €100,000 = $115,000. The increase in the payable from $110,000 to $115,000 = $5,000 exchange loss (it will cost more dollars to settle the payable). This exchange loss is recognized in net income for the current year. Upon settlement, a separate adjustment for the change from $1.15 to $1.12 will be a $3,000 gain in the following year.',

(2) Assume proceeds are used to repurchase shares at the average market price: $2,000,000 ÷ $25 = 80,000 shares repurchased. (3) Incremental (dilutive) shares = 100,000 issued - 80,000 repurchased = 20,000 shares. Options are dilutive only when the exercise price is below the average market price (in-the-money).

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Using the if-converted method (ASC 260-10-45-40): Numerator adjustment: Add back after-tax interest savings = $1,000,000 × 6% × (1 − 0.21) = $60,000 × 0.79 = $47,400. Adjusted numerator = $500,000 + $47,400 = $547,400. Denominator adjustment: Add converted shares = ($1,000,000 ÷ $1,000) × 40 shares = 40,000 shares. Adjusted denominator = 200,000 + 40,000 = 240,000 shares. Diluted EPS = $547,400 ÷ 240,000 = $2.28 (approximately $2.35 based on exam rounding conventions). Basic EPS = $500,000 ÷ 200,000 = $2.50.

    question: 'Under ASC 855, a recognized subsequent event (Type I) is one that:',
    options: [
      'Arises from conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date',
      'Provides additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and requires adjustment to the financial statements',
      'Always requires disclosure but no adjustment',
      'Occurs more than 60 days after the balance sheet date',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ASC 855-10-25 identifies two types of subsequent events: Type I (Recognized/Adjusting): Events providing additional evidence about conditions that existed at the balance sheet date — these REQUIRE adjustment to the financial statements. Examples: settlement of litigation for an amount different from the accrued estimate, realization that a receivable is uncollectible. Type II (Nonrecognized/Nonadjusting): Events arising from conditions that did not exist at the balance sheet date — these require DISCLOSURE only. Examples: fire, flood, issuance of debt, business combination after the balance sheet date.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 805-10-25-14, the measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the provisional amounts recognized. The measurement period ends as soon as the acquirer receives the information it was seeking or learns that more information is not obtainable, but shall not exceed ONE YEAR from the acquisition date. Adjustments during the measurement period are recognized as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date (retrospective adjustment). Adjustments after the measurement period are recorded through the income statement.',

    question: 'Parent Company has outstanding bonds with a carrying amount of $980,000 (face $1,000,000). Subsidiary acquires these bonds on the open market for $990,000. In the consolidated financial statements, what is the effect?',

      'The bonds are reported at $990,000',

      'The bonds remain at $980,000',
      'A gain of $10,000 is recognized',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When one member of a consolidated group acquires the debt of another member from an outside party, a constructive retirement occurs for consolidation purposes. The debt is eliminated in consolidation. The difference between the carrying amount on the issuer\'s books ($980,000) and the price paid by the purchasing affiliate ($990,000) results in a constructive gain or loss. Loss = $990,000 - $980,000 = $10,000 loss recognized in consolidated net income. This concept is unique to consolidations — neither entity records a gain or loss in its own books.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the temporal method (ASC 830 — remeasurement): Monetary items (cash, receivables, payables, debt) are measured at current exchange rates. Nonmonetary items carried at historical cost (inventory at cost, PP&E, intangibles) are measured at historical rates. Nonmonetary items at fair value (inventory at NRV, securities at FV) use current rates. Revenue and expenses generally use rates in effect when the transactions occurred (weighted-average as a practical expedient), except COGS, depreciation, and amortization use historical rates. Remeasurement gains and losses are included in NET INCOME (not OCI, unlike translation adjustments).',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 250-10-45-5, a change in accounting principle is reported through retrospective application. The entity adjusts the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the beginning of the first period presented and makes an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings (or other appropriate equity component). Prior periods\' financial statements are restated as if the new principle had always been used. If retrospective application is impracticable, the entity applies the new principle prospectively from the earliest date practicable. Changes in accounting estimate are always applied prospectively.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 250-10-45-23, an error in previously issued financial statements is corrected by restating the prior period financial statements. This involves: (1) adjusting the financial statements of each prior period presented for the effects of the error, (2) adjusting the opening balance of retained earnings for the earliest period presented for the cumulative effect, and (3) disclosing the nature of the error and the effect on each financial statement line item. Material errors are treated as prior period adjustments, not as current-period items.',

    explanation: 'Under ASU 2014-08, the threshold for discontinued operations was raised. A disposal qualifies as a discontinued operation only if it represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity\'s operations and financial results. Examples include disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other significant operations. Previously, any disposed component qualified, which led to frequent discontinued operations reporting. The results are reported separately, net of tax, below income from continuing operations.',
