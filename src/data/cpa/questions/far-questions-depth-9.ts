    question: 'A lessee with a 10-year finance lease (remaining ROU asset of $300,000 and lease liability of $320,000) negotiates an early termination at the end of Year 5. The termination penalty is $25,000. What gain or loss is recognized?',
    options: [
      'Gain of $20,000',
      'Loss of $5,000 — ($320,000 lease liability − $300,000 ROU asset − $25,000 penalty payment)',
      'Loss of $25,000',
      'Loss of $45,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Upon lease termination, the lessee derecognizes the ROU asset and lease liability and recognizes any difference (including the termination penalty) as a gain or loss. Journal entry: Debit Lease Liability $320,000; Credit ROU Asset $300,000; Credit Cash $25,000. The net effect: removing the $320,000 liability is favorable (reduces obligations by $320,000), but removing the $300,000 ROU asset and paying $25,000 cash totals $325,000 given up. Net result = $320,000 − $325,000 = $(5,000) loss. The penalty payment causes the loss because the cash outflow exceeds the difference between the liability removed and asset given up.',

    question: 'A lessee occupies 3 floors under a 10-year operating lease. In Year 4, the lease is modified to surrender 1 floor (one-third of the leased space), reducing future payments proportionally. The ROU asset is $900,000 and lease liability is $960,000 before modification. How is the partial termination accounted for?',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-20-25-8, a lease modification that is a partial termination requires: (1) Reduce the ROU asset proportionally: 1/3 × $900,000 = $300,000 reduction. New ROU = $600,000. (2) Remeasure the lease liability for the reduced scope: Approximately 1/3 × $960,000 = $320,000 reduction. New liability ≈ $640,000. (3) The difference between the proportional reduction in the liability ($320,000) and the ROU asset ($300,000) = $20,000 gain recognized at the modification date. The remaining lease continues with the adjusted amounts.',

    question: 'A company has a PBO of $2,000,000, plan assets at fair value of $1,800,000, and net unrecognized actuarial loss of $250,000 at the beginning of the year. The average remaining service period of active employees is 10 years. Under the corridor approach, the minimum amortization of net actuarial loss included in pension cost is:',

      '$0 — the loss is within the corridor',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 715-30-35-24 (corridor approach): The corridor equals 10% of the greater of the PBO ($2,000,000) or plan assets ($1,800,000) = 10% × $2,000,000 = $200,000. The unrecognized net actuarial loss ($250,000) exceeds the corridor ($200,000) by $50,000. The minimum amortization = excess ÷ average remaining service period = $50,000 ÷ 10 = $5,000 per year. This $5,000 is included as a component of net periodic pension cost. The corridor approach delays recognition of actuarial gains and losses, smoothing their impact on pension cost. Companies may also elect to recognize gains/losses immediately through net income.',

(2) Subsequently amortized from accumulated OCI to net periodic pension cost over the future service periods of active employees expected to receive benefits (typically using the straight-line method over the average remaining service period). $120,000 ÷ 8 years = $15,000 per year amortized from AOCI to pension expense.

    question: 'A company settles a portion of its pension obligation by purchasing annuity contracts for retired participants. The settlement eliminates $500,000 of the PBO, and the cost of the annuity contracts is $480,000 (from plan assets). The plan had unrecognized net actuarial gains totaling $100,000 and the total PBO before settlement is $2,000,000. What settlement gain is recognized?',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 715-30-35-79, a settlement requires the entity to recognize a proportionate share of unrecognized gains or losses in net income. Proportion settled = $500,000 ÷ $2,000,000 = 25% of the PBO. Proportionate unrecognized net gain = 25% × $100,000 = $25,000 recognized. Additionally, the excess of obligation settled over assets used: $500,000 − $480,000 = $20,000 gain. Total settlement gain = $20,000 + $25,000 = $45,000.

    question: 'A company grants 5,000 shares of restricted stock to an employee on January 1, Year 1. The shares vest at the end of Year 3. Grant-date market price is $40 per share. The employee does not make a Section 83(b) election. What is the total compensation expense recognized over the vesting period?',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 718-10-30-2, the fair value of restricted stock awards is measured at the grant-date market price of the stock ($40 × 5,000 = $200,000). This is the total compensation cost, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period (vesting period of 3 years): $200,000 ÷ 3 = $66,667 per year. The fair value is NOT remeasured after the grant date (unlike liability-classified awards). If the shares are forfeited before vesting, previously recognized compensation expense is reversed.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 718-20-35-3, when an award is modified (Type I — probable-to-probable vesting), the entity recognizes: (1) The original cost continues — the remaining unrecognized cost from the original award. At 60% complete: original total = $10 × 1,000 = $10,000; recognized so far = $6,000; remaining = $4,000. (2) Incremental cost = (new FV − old FV) × number of options = ($14 − $10) × 1,000 = $4,000. This incremental cost is recognized over the remaining service period. (3) Total remaining cost = $4,000 (orig. remaining) + $4,000 (incremental) = $8,000 over remaining 40% of the service period.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'An appropriation of retained earnings is a restriction that signals to financial statement users that a portion of retained earnings is not available for dividend distribution. Common reasons include contractual restrictions (bond covenants), legal requirements, or voluntary management decisions (e.g., plant expansion). IMPORTANT: An appropriation does NOT set aside cash or any other assets — it is purely a reclassification within retained earnings (from unappropriated to appropriated). Total retained earnings and total stockholders\' equity are unchanged. When the restriction is no longer needed, the appropriation is reversed back to unappropriated retained earnings.',

      '$100,000 reduces retained earnings (to zero) and $50,000 is a return of capital (reduces additional paid-in capital)',
      'The entire $150,000 is classified as dividend expense',
      'The $50,000 is classified as a loss on the income statement',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When dividends exceed retained earnings, the excess is a liquidating dividend — a return of the shareholders\' invested capital, not a distribution of earnings. Debits: Retained Earnings $100,000 (reducing it to zero) and APIC $50,000, Credit Cash $150,000. The recipient of a liquidating dividend should not treat the return of capital portion as dividend income — it reduces the investor\'s cost basis in the investment. Companies in extractive industries (mining, oil/gas) may declare liquidating dividends as a normal practice when their assets are being depleted. Adequate disclosure of the nature of the dividend is required.',

      'A deferred tax asset is created',
      'The difference is a permanent difference with no deferred tax impact',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'This is a classic indefinite reversal concept. Book goodwill is not amortized (tested for impairment under ASC 350), while tax goodwill is amortized under IRC §197 (over 15 years). Each year, the tax basis decreases (due to amortization) while the book basis remains constant (assuming no impairment), creating a taxable temporary difference that generates an ever-increasing DTL. Under ASC 740-10-25-20, this DTL must be recognized because the difference is a temporary difference (it will reverse when the goodwill is eventually disposed of or impaired). Unlike pre-2001 APB 17 treatment, there is no exception for this type of goodwill temporary difference.',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'To determine income tax expense: Start with pre-tax book income ($1,000,000). Permanent differences: Tax-exempt interest ($50,000) reduces taxable income permanently, nondeductible fines ($30,000) increase taxable income permanently. Taxable income approximation: $1,000,000 − $50,000 + $30,000 = $980,000. However, income tax expense per GAAP has two components: (1) Current tax expense based on taxable income, and (2) Deferred tax expense for temporary differences. With no temporary differences stated, total tax expense = $980,000 × 21% = $205,800. Wait — permanent differences affect both book and taxable income the same way. Actually: Tax expense = ($1,000,000 − $50,000 + $30,000) × 21% = $205,800. Effective rate = 20.58%.',

    explanation: 'Units-of-production depreciation: Depreciable base = Cost − Salvage = $400,000 − $40,000 = $360,000. Per-unit rate = $360,000 ÷ 180,000 units = $2.00 per unit. Year 1 depreciation = 30,000 units × $2.00 = $60,000. This method is appropriate when the asset\'s usefulness is more closely related to use (production) than to the passage of time. It results in a variable depreciation charge each year based on actual output. Examples include mining equipment, delivery vehicles (miles-driven basis), and manufacturing machinery.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 350-50, web site development costs follow a stage-based model similar to internal-use software (ASC 350-40): (1) Planning stage: Costs are expensed as incurred (feasibility analysis, tech selection). (2) Application and infrastructure development stage: Costs are capitalized (coding, testing, data conversion, purchasing/designing graphics). (3) Operating stage: Costs are generally expensed (training, admin, maintenance), but upgrades/enhancements that add functionality may be capitalized. Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated useful life (typically 2-5 years for web site elements).',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-55-80, consignment arrangements do not represent a sale from the consignor to the consignee. The consignor retains control of the goods — the consignee is merely holding them for the consignor\'s benefit. Revenue is recognized only when the goods are sold to the end customer by the consignee (the point at which control transfers to the ultimate buyer). Indicators of consignment include: (1) the consignor controls the product until a specified event occurs, (2) the consignor can require return of products, (3) the consignee does not have an unconditional obligation to pay. The goods remain in the consignor\'s inventory until sold.',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-55-41, if a customer option provides a "material right" (a discount the customer would not receive without entering into the contract), it is treated as a separate performance obligation. The standalone selling price of the product is $100 (what the customer pays), and the standalone selling price of the option right is estimated at $20, for a total of $120. Allocating $100 on a relative basis: Product = ($100/$120) × $100 = $83.33; Coupon (material right) = ($20/$120) × $100 = $16.67. The $16.67 is a contract liability recognized as revenue when the coupon is exercised or expires.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under the equity method (ASC 323-10-35-7), intercompany profits must be eliminated from equity income. The treatment differs based on direction: DOWNSTREAM sale (investor sells to investee): The investor eliminates 100% of unrealized profit because the investor is the seller and all profit relates to them. UPSTREAM sale (investee sells to investor): The investor eliminates only its ownership share of unrealized profit. In this case, Investor sold to Investee (downstream). Total profit = $200,000 − $150,000 = $50,000. Unrealized portion = 25% remaining unsold × $50,000 = $12,500. Since this is downstream, Investor eliminates the full $12,500 from its equity method income in the current period. When Investee sells the inventory to third parties, Investor will recognize its share of that profit.',
