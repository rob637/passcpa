    question: 'Parker Corp. sells specialized equipment for $2 million with delivery in 18 months. The customer pays the full amount upfront. A comparable financing arrangement would carry a 6% annual interest rate. Under ASC 606, how should Parker account for the significant financing component?',

      'Recognize $2 million revenue at delivery with no adjustment',
      'Recognize $2 million revenue immediately upon receipt of cash',

      'Recognize revenue at the future value of the $2 million payment adjusted for 18 months of interest',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606-10-32-15, when there is a significant financing component (payment timing differs substantially from performance), the transaction price is adjusted. Since the customer pays upfront (18 months before delivery), Parker has received financing. Revenue is measured at the present value of the $2 million payment at inception. Parker recognizes interest expense over the 18-month period (accretion of the financing obligation). Revenue recognized at delivery will exceed the cash received.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-10-15-37, variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate (e.g., CPI adjustments) ARE included in the lease liability. However, variable payments based on performance or usage (such as a percentage of revenues) are NOT included in the lease liability measurement.
