    question: 'Raven Construction enters a $10 million fixed-price contract with an estimated total cost of $7.5 million. By year-end, costs incurred are $3 million and progress billings total $3.2 million. Using the input method (cost-to-cost), what revenue should Raven recognize in Year 1?',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 606 input method (cost-to-cost): Percentage complete = $3,000,000 ÷ $7,500,000 = 40%. Revenue recognized = 40% × $10,000,000 = $4,000,000. The $3,200,000 in progress billings does not determine revenue recognition — it only affects the contract asset/liability balance. Gross profit recognized = $4,000,000 − $3,000,000 = $1,000,000.',
