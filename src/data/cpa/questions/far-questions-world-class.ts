      '$144,000',
      '$150,000',
      '$156,000'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Dollar-Value LIFO Steps: (1) Convert current cost to base-year dollars: $150,000 ÷ 1.25 = $120,000. (2) Compare to base layer ($120,000). (3) Since deflated current cost ($120,000) equals the base layer, there is no new layer increment. (4) Dollar-value LIFO inventory = base layer at base-year cost. If the base layer was less than $120,000 (e.g., $100,000), then there would be a $20,000 layer at the current index: $100,000 + ($20,000 × 1.25) = $125,000. Answer B ($144,000) suggests a different base layer configuration with incremental layers at various price indices.',
