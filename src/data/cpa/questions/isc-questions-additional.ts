    question: 'An organization\'s IT security team conducts a tabletop exercise simulating a ransomware attack on the financial reporting infrastructure. During the exercise, participants discover that: (1) the incident response plan does not address ransomware specifically, (2) no one knows whether to pay the ransom, (3) backup restoration has never been tested, and (4) the communication plan does not include regulators or investors. What should the auditor conclude?',
    options: [
      'Tabletop exercises reveal theoretical issues that do not require action',
      'The exercise exposed critical gaps in incident preparedness — the organization lacks specific ransomware procedures, has no ransom payment policy, cannot verify backup recoverability, and has inadequate stakeholder communication plans, all of which should be remediated',
      'Ransomware attacks are rare enough that specific planning is unnecessary',
      'The communication plan only needs to include internal stakeholders',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Tabletop exercises are designed to identify gaps before real incidents occur. The findings reveal: (1) no ransomware playbook (a common and critical threat), (2) no pre-authorized decision framework for ransom payments (a board-level decision), (3) untested backups (the primary defense against ransomware), and (4) incomplete communication plans (regulators may require breach notification within specific timeframes).

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A qualification in a SOC report requires the user auditor to evaluate: (1) whether the control exception is relevant to assertions being tested, (2) whether complementary user entity controls or other service organization controls mitigate the risk, (3) the period and frequency of the exception, and (4) whether additional audit procedures are needed to address the residual risk.

What governance concern does this raise?',
    options: [
      'Management has absolute discretion in risk acceptance decisions',

The cold site has basic infrastructure (power, cooling, network connections) but no pre-installed hardware or software. What is the primary limitation the auditor should evaluate?',    options: [    'Cold sites are the most expensive recovery option',    'The recovery time for a cold site is significantly longer than hot or warm sites — procuring, installing, and configuring hardware and software could take days to weeks, which may not meet the entity\'s recovery time objectives for financial reporting',    'Cold sites provide real-time replication of data',    'Cold sites are only appropriate for non-critical systems',    ],    correctAnswer: 1,    explanation: 'Cold sites offer minimal cost but maximum recovery time. Without pre-installed systems, the entity must source hardware, install OS and applications, restore data from backups, and test — a process taking days to weeks. If the entity\'s RTO for financial reporting is measured in hours (typical for public company reporting deadlines), a cold site is likely inadequate. The auditor should evaluate whether the RTO aligns with financial reporting requirements.',    reference: 'Backup Best Practices',  },

    question: 'An organization outsources its entire IT function to a managed service provider (MSP). The service level agreement (SLA) specifies 99.9% uptime for the financial reporting system.

    options: [
      '97.2% uptime is acceptable for financial systems',
