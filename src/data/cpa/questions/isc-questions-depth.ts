      'Internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) at a service organization',
      'The organization\'s compliance with privacy regulations',
      'The effectiveness of the organization\'s cybersecurity program',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'SOC 1 reports (SSAE 18/AT-C 320) evaluate controls at a service organization relevant to user entities\' internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). Common for payroll processors, hosting providers for financial applications, and claims processors. SOC 2 reports address the five Trust Services Criteria (security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, privacy).',

      'Type I covers security only; Type II covers all Trust Services Criteria',
      'Type I describes controls and tests their design at a point in time; Type II tests operating effectiveness over a period',
      'Type I is for service organizations; Type II is for user entities',
      'Type I is performed by internal audit; Type II is performed by external auditors',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Type I reports evaluate the suitability of design of controls at a specific point in time (snapshot). Type II reports evaluate both design suitability AND operating effectiveness of controls over a defined period (typically 6-12 months). Type II reports are generally more valuable because they provide evidence that controls operated consistently. Both types can cover any combination of Trust Services Criteria.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The five Trust Services Criteria (TSC) are: (1) Security (common criteria, always required) — protection against unauthorized access; (2) Availability — system is available for operation and use; (3) Processing Integrity — system processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized; (4) Confidentiality — information designated as confidential is protected; (5) Privacy — personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of properly.',

      'Controls performed by a subservice organization',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'CUECs are controls that the service organization assumes the user entity has in place. For example, a payroll service organization may assume the user entity has proper authorization controls for approving payroll changes. User entity auditors must evaluate whether their client has implemented the relevant CUECs identified in the SOC report. Failure to implement CUECs can create control gaps even when the service organization\'s controls are operating effectively.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'SOC 3 reports are general-use reports designed for public distribution (e.g., posted on a website). They contain a practitioner\'s opinion on whether controls are effective but exclude the detailed description of tests and results found in SOC 2 reports. SOC 2 reports are restricted-use — intended only for management, user entities, and their auditors. Both SOC 2 and SOC 3 use the same Trust Services Criteria.',

      'Carve-out method',

    explanation: 'Two methods for presenting subservice organizations: (1) Inclusive method — the subservice organization\'s controls are tested and included in the service organization\'s SOC report; (2) Carve-out method — the subservice organization\'s controls are excluded, and the report identifies the types of controls expected at the subservice organization.

      'Immutability — once recorded, transactions cannot be altered',
      'Lower cost than traditional transaction processing',
      'Blockchain does not require internet connectivity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Blockchain\'s immutability is its most audit-relevant feature. Once a block is added to the chain and validated by consensus, it cannot be retroactively altered without consensus from the network. This creates a tamper-evident, time-stamped record of transactions — potentially providing reliable audit evidence. However, immutability does not guarantee the accuracy of the initial input (garbage in, garbage out).',

      'AI models cannot process numerical data',
      'Machine learning requires manual data entry',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Key risks of AI/ML in accounting include: (1) bias in training data producing systematically biased results, (2) lack of explainability ("black box" problem) making it difficult to justify decisions to regulators, (3) data quality issues amplified by automation, (4) model drift over time requiring ongoing monitoring, and (5) overreliance without proper human oversight.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'IaaS places the most security responsibility on the customer. The provider manages the physical infrastructure, but the customer is responsible for the OS, middleware, applications, and data. With PaaS, the provider also manages the OS and middleware. With SaaS, the provider manages nearly everything — the customer mainly manages access control and data governance. Understanding the shared responsibility model is critical for IT audit planning.',

    correctAnswer: 1,

      'Can only be used for cryptocurrency transactions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Smart contracts automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, creating audit-relevant considerations: (1) code review — the logic must be verified (bugs or exploits can exist), (2) oracle dependency — if the contract relies on external data feeds (oracles), those inputs must be evaluated, (3) immutability — once deployed, errors may be difficult to correct, (4) the business logic encoded must be consistent with the entity\'s accounting policies.',

    explanation: 'Benford\'s Law states that in naturally occurring data sets, the leading digit "1" appears about 30.1% of the time, "2" about 17.6%, with decreasing frequency through "9" (4.6%).

    explanation: 'Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) protects data while it moves between systems, preventing eavesdropping (interception) and man-in-the-middle attacks. It ensures confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission. Encryption at rest protects stored data. A comprehensive encryption strategy includes both. TLS 1.3 (the latest version) provides improved security and performance over TLS 1.2.',

      'It uses different auditing standards',
      'It produces audit evidence in real-time or near-real-time through automated procedures applied to electronic data',
      'It eliminates the need for an audit opinion',
      'It is only applicable to IT audits',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Continuous auditing uses automated tools to test transactions and controls on an ongoing basis rather than periodically. Key components: (1) continuous control monitoring (CCM) — automated testing of control effectiveness, (2) continuous data assurance (CDA) — real-time testing of transaction data, (3) exception reporting — automated alerts for anomalies, and (4) continuous risk monitoring and assessment. It enables faster detection of errors, fraud, and control breakdowns.',
