    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'SOC 1 reports (SSAE 18/AT-C 320) evaluate controls at a service organization relevant to user entities\' internal control over financial reporting (ICFR). Common for payroll processors, hosting providers for financial applications, and claims processors.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Type I reports evaluate the suitability of design of controls at a specific point in time (snapshot). Type II reports evaluate both design suitability AND operating effectiveness of controls over a defined period (typically 6-12 months). Type II reports are generally more valuable because they provide evidence that controls operated consistently. Both types can cover any combination of Trust Services Criteria.',

For example, a payroll service organization may assume the user entity has proper authorization controls for approving payroll changes. User entity auditors must evaluate whether their client has implemented the relevant CUECs identified in the SOC report.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Blockchain\'s immutability is its most audit-relevant feature. Once a block is added to the chain and validated by consensus, it cannot be retroactively altered without consensus from the network. This creates a tamper-evident, time-stamped record of transactions — potentially providing reliable audit evidence.

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Key risks of AI/ML in accounting include: (1) bias in training data producing systematically biased results, (2) lack of explainability ("black box" problem) making it difficult to justify decisions to regulators, (3) data quality issues amplified by automation, (4) model drift over time requiring ongoing monitoring, and (5) overreliance without proper human oversight.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'IaaS places the most security responsibility on the customer. The provider manages the physical infrastructure, but the customer is responsible for the OS, middleware, applications, and data. With PaaS, the provider also manages the OS and middleware.

    options: [
      'Segregation of duties is not necessary when the individual is experienced and trusted',

    explanation: 'Data governance addresses: (1) data ownership — who is responsible for data accuracy, (2) data stewardship — who manages day-to-day data quality, (3) data quality standards — completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness, (4) data classification — sensitivity levels, (5) data lifecycle — retention, archival, disposal policies, (6) regulatory compliance — GDPR, SOX, HIPAA. Programming language selection is a systems development decision, not data governance.',

    question: 'Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a data controller must report a personal data breach to the supervisory authority within:',
    options: [
      '30 calendar days of the breach',
      '7 business days of the breach',
      '24 hours of discovery',
      '72 hours of becoming aware of the breach',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'GDPR Article 33 requires data controllers to notify the supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to individuals\' rights. Data subjects must be notified "without undue delay" if the breach poses a high risk (Article 34). Fines can reach €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is higher.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL) protects data while it moves between systems, preventing eavesdropping (interception) and man-in-the-middle attacks. It ensures confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission. Encryption at rest protects stored data. A comprehensive encryption strategy includes both. TLS 1.3 (the latest version) provides improved security and performance over TLS 1.2.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Continuous auditing uses automated tools to test transactions and controls on an ongoing basis rather than periodically. Key components: (1) continuous control monitoring (CCM) — automated testing of control effectiveness, (2) continuous data assurance (CDA) — real-time testing of transaction data, (3) exception reporting — automated alerts for anomalies, and (4) continuous risk monitoring and assessment. It enables faster detection of errors, fraud, and control breakdowns.',
