    question: 'An organization\'s IT governance committee includes the CIO, CFO, COO, and CISO. The committee meets quarterly to review IT strategy, risk, and investment decisions. The auditor discovers that the committee has not met in 8 months and that the CIO has been making all IT investment and risk decisions independently. What governance failure does this represent?',
    options: [
      'IT governance committees are optional advisory bodies',
      'The committee\'s inactivity concentrates IT decision-making authority in the CIO without oversight — governance committees exist to provide checks and balances, and their absence means IT risk acceptance, investment prioritization, and strategy decisions lack multi-stakeholder input and accountability',
      'The CIO has sufficient authority to make all IT decisions independently',
      'Governance committees create bureaucratic delays and should meet annually at most',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IT governance committees serve essential functions: (1) multi-stakeholder oversight of IT investments, (2) risk acceptance decisions that affect the entire organization, (3) strategic alignment validation, (4) accountability for IT outcomes. When the committee stops meeting, these functions collapse into a single individual, eliminating checks and balances.

    question: 'An organization\'s board of directors requests a quarterly cybersecurity risk report. The CISO presents a report showing zero security incidents for the quarter. The auditor independently reviews the SIEM logs and discovers 47 security events that were classified as \'informational\' rather than \'incidents\' by the security team, including 3 events where unauthorized users accessed the financial reporting system. What concern does this raise?',
    options: [
    'Classification of events as informational is at the CISO\'s discretion and is always appropriate',
    'The classification methodology may be underreporting actual incidents — reclassifying security events that involved unauthorized access to financial systems as \'informational\' misrepresents the organization\'s security posture to the board and may indicate a bias toward favorable reporting',
    'The board report accurately reflects the security posture if the CISO approved it',
    'Only events resulting in financial loss should be classified as incidents',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The discrepancy between reported incidents (zero) and actual security events (47, including 3 with unauthorized financial system access) suggests problematic classification criteria. Unauthorized access to financial systems should trigger incident classification regardless of whether damage occurred. The board receives inaccurate risk information, undermining their governance role. The auditor should evaluate the incident classification criteria and the completeness of board reporting.',

The WAF is configured with default rules and has not been tuned since initial deployment. The security team reports that the WAF blocks 2,000 requests daily, but upon investigation, 95% are false positives (legitimate customer transactions). What operational risk does this create?',
    options: [
      'A high false positive rate demonstrates the WAF is working effectively',
      'Blocking 1,900 legitimate customer transactions daily causes service disruption — customers cannot access their accounts or complete transactions, creating revenue loss, customer dissatisfaction, and potential regulatory concerns about service availability',
      'WAF false positives are expected and do not require tuning',
      'The WAF should be disabled to prevent blocking legitimate traffic',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'An untuned WAF with 95% false positives is counterproductive: (1) legitimate customers are denied service (1,900 blocked legitimate requests daily), (2) the security team cannot identify real attacks amid the noise, (3) business operations are disrupted, and (4) the organization may disable the WAF entirely, removing the control.

    question: 'An organization operates a data warehouse that combines financial data from multiple source systems for reporting and analytics. The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes run nightly and include complex data transformations. The auditor discovers that the ETL processes have no reconciliation controls — no record counts, hash totals, or data validation checks between source systems and the data warehouse. What concern does this raise?',
    options: [
      'ETL processes are technical operations outside the scope of financial auditing',
      'Without reconciliation controls, data may be lost, duplicated, or incorrectly transformed during the ETL process — the accuracy and completeness of financial reports generated from the data warehouse cannot be assured',
      'ETL technology automatically ensures data integrity',
      'Reconciliation controls are only needed for real-time data processing',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'ETL processes are critical control points where data integrity can be compromised. Without reconciliation controls: (1) records may be dropped during extraction, (2) transformations may produce incorrect results, (3) load failures may not be detected, (4) duplicate records may inflate financial totals. The auditor should assess whether data warehouse-sourced reports are used for financial reporting and recommend implementing record counts, hash totals, and data validation checks.',

    question: 'An auditor is evaluating the organization\'s password policy for financial applications. The policy requires 8-character minimum passwords with complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character). However, the auditor discovers that the password policy is not technically enforced — users can create passwords of any length and complexity. The policy exists only as a written document. What is the control gap?',
    options: [
      'Written policies are sufficient even without technical enforcement',
      'The password policy is a manual control with no technical enforcement — users may create weak passwords that are easily guessable or crackable, and the organization cannot demonstrate that the policy is actually followed without technical controls',
      '8-character passwords with complexity requirements provide adequate security regardless of enforcement',
      'Password policies are outdated and no longer necessary with modern authentication',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A policy without technical enforcement is a paper control. Without automated enforcement: (1) users can create weak passwords (\'password1\'), (2) there is no assurance the policy is followed, (3) the control is detective (auditing compliance after the fact) rather than preventive (blocking weak passwords), (4) relying on user compliance alone is insufficient. Technical enforcement through system configuration is essential for password policies to be effective.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'After a ransomware attack, data integrity is the primary audit concern. Ransomware operators may exfiltrate or modify data before encryption. The auditor should: (1) evaluate whether backup data used for restoration is from a pre-compromise state, (2) assess data integrity through reconciliation and validation procedures, (3) evaluate the completeness of restored data, (4) consider whether the attack introduced additional modifications, and (5) assess whether IT forensics confirmed no data manipulation.',
