      'Ensuring that database backups are performed regularly',
      'Ensuring that foreign key values match existing primary key values',
      'Ensuring that all data is encrypted at rest',
      'Ensuring that all tables have a primary key defined',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. A foreign key in one table must reference a valid primary key in another table, or be null. This prevents orphaned records.',

One user can now create vendors, enter invoices, and approve payments. What is the primary control implication?',
    options: [
      'This is acceptable during a staffing transition period',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Segregation of duties is a fundamental control that prevents any single individual from being able to both perpetrate and conceal fraud. When one person can perform all three functions (vendor creation, invoice entry, payment approval), the entire payment cycle lacks independent oversight. This creates a classic \'ghost vendor\' fraud scenario.

    question: 'An organization\'s information security program requires that all portable devices containing financial data must be encrypted. The auditor discovers that 40% of company laptops used by the accounting department do not have disk encryption enabled. Several laptops were reported lost during the year. What should the auditor consider?',
    options: [
      'Disk encryption is a convenience feature, not a security control',
      'The unencrypted laptops with financial data create a data breach risk — lost laptops without encryption may require breach notification, and the failure to enforce a mandatory policy represents a control deviation that should be reported as a deficiency',
      'Encryption is only necessary for laptops used by executives',
      'The auditor should only be concerned about the lost laptops, not the encryption status',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When mandatory encryption policies are not enforced and devices are lost, the organization faces: (1) potential data breach notification requirements (many regulations assume unencrypted lost devices are breaches), (2) regulatory penalties, (3) reputational damage, and (4) evidence of a broader control environment weakness. The auditor should assess the financial exposure from the lost unencrypted laptops and evaluate the control program\'s effectiveness.',
