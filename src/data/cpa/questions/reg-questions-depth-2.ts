    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC §6694(a): Unreasonable position penalty (no substantial authority, or no reasonable basis with adequate disclosure) = greater of $1,000 or 50% of preparer income from the return. §6694(b): Willful/reckless conduct penalty (willful attempt to understate, reckless/intentional disregard of rules) = greater of $5,000 or 75% of income from the return.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC §7525 extends a limited privilege (similar to attorney-client) to tax advice from CPAs, EAs, and enrolled actuaries. Limitations: (1) applies only in non-criminal tax matters before the IRS or federal courts, (2) does NOT apply to written communications regarding tax shelters involving corporations, (3) does NOT apply in criminal proceedings, (4) only covers tax advice, not return preparation.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC §1250: Only recaptures excess of accelerated depreciation over straight-line as ordinary income. Since post-1986 real property must use straight-line (MACRS), there is typically no §1250 recapture. However, "unrecaptured §1250 gain" (the straight-line depreciation taken on the property) is taxed at a maximum rate of 25% (instead of the regular 15%/20% LTCG rate). Example: Building bought $500K, $200K SL depreciation (basis $300K), sold for $600K. Total gain = $300K. Unrecaptured §1250 (25% rate) = $200K. Remaining §1231 gain (20% rate) = $100K.',

Hot assets: (1) Unrealized receivables — includes recapture potential (§1245/1250) and receivables for services/goods, (2) Substantially appreciated inventory — FMV > 120% of basis. When selling a partnership interest, the partner must separately calculate: ordinary income on the hot asset portion, capital gain on the remainder.
