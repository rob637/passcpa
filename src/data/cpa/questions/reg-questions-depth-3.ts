    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC §6321: A federal tax lien arises when three conditions are met: (1) assessment of tax, (2) notice and demand for payment sent to taxpayer, (3) taxpayer neglects or refuses to pay. The lien attaches to all property and rights to property (real and personal, including after-acquired property). The lien is NOT automatically enforceable against certain third parties until a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) is publicly filed. Priority: generally first-in-time among filed liens, but superpriority creditors (certain purchasers, holders of security interests, mechanic\'s lien holders) may prevail.',

    explanation: 'IRC §179 (2024): Maximum deduction = $1,220,000 (indexed annually). Phase-out begins when qualifying asset purchases exceed $3,050,000 (dollar-for-dollar reduction). Qualifying property: tangible personal property, off-the-shelf software, qualified real property (QRIP — HVAC, roofs, fire protection, security). NOT eligible: buildings, structural components, land. Additional limitations: (1) Cannot exceed business taxable income (excess carries forward), (2) Must be used >50% for business. §179 is elected per asset (unlike bonus depreciation which is all-or-nothing by class).',

    explanation: 'IRC §168(k) bonus depreciation phase-down schedule: 2022: 100%, 2023: 80%, 2024: 60%, 2025: 40%, 2026: 20%, 2027+: 0%. Applies to new and used property with a recovery period of 20 years or less, plus MACRS 15-year qualified improvement property (QIP). Unlike §179: no taxable income limitation, no investment cap, applies to all qualifying assets (can\'t select individual assets). Can create an NOL. Taxpayers can elect out of bonus depreciation by class of property. Many practitioners use a combination of §179 and bonus depreciation for optimal tax planning.',

    explanation: 'UCC §2-314: Implied warranty of merchantability arises automatically in sales by a merchant (seller who deals in goods of that kind). Merchantable goods must: (1) pass without objection in the trade, (2) be fit for ordinary purposes, (3) be within the contract description, (4) be of even kind/quality, (5) be adequately packaged/labeled, (6) conform to label promises.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'UCC §2-207 modifies the common law mirror image rule. Between merchants: additional terms become part of the contract UNLESS: (1) the offer expressly limits acceptance to its terms, (2) the additional terms materially alter the contract (arbitration clauses, limitation of remedies), (3) notification of objection has been or is given within a reasonable time. Between a merchant and non-merchant: additional terms are merely proposals.
