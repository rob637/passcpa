      'Have no more than 100 shareholders (with family members treated as one)',
      'Have only individuals, estates, and certain trusts as shareholders',
      'Have shareholders who are citizens or resident aliens',
      'Must have at least 2 shareholders',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under §1361(b), S corporation eligibility requires: (1) domestic corporation; (2) no more than 100 shareholders (members of a family within 6 generations can elect to be treated as one shareholder); (3) only eligible shareholders — individuals, estates, certain trusts (grantor trusts, QSSTs, ESBTs), and tax-exempt organizations under §401(a) or §501(c)(3); (4) shareholders must be US citizens or resident aliens (no nonresident alien shareholders); (5) only one class of stock (voting rights may differ); (6) not an ineligible corporation (certain financial institutions, insurance companies, DISCs). An S corporation may have only ONE shareholder — there is no minimum requirement. Partnerships, corporations, and nonresident aliens cannot be S corporation shareholders.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §1367, an S corporation shareholder\'s stock basis is adjusted annually: INCREASES: (1) ordinary business income (pro rata share); (2) separately stated income items (capital gains, §1231 gains, tax-exempt interest, etc.); (3) additional capital contributions; (4) the excess of deduction for depletion over basis of property. DECREASES (in order): (1) distributions (not included in income); (2) nondeductible, noncapital expenses (fines, penalties, 50% of meals, life insurance premiums); (3) depletion deduction; (4) ordinary losses and separately stated loss items. Important distinctions from partnerships: S corporation shareholders do NOT increase basis for corporate-level debt (unlike partners who include their share of partnership liabilities in basis). Only loans made directly FROM the shareholder TO the corporation create "debt basis" that allows additional loss deductions.',

      'An S corporation has been an S corporation since inception',
      'The S corporation has losses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The built-in gains tax (§1374) prevents C corporations from avoiding corporate-level tax by converting to S status and then selling appreciated assets: (1) applies to C-to-S conversions — not to corporations that have always been S corporations; (2) recognition period — the tax applies to dispositions within a 5-year period beginning on the first day of the first S corporation year; (3) the tax applies to the lesser of: (a) the net recognized built-in gain for the year, or (b) the taxable income of the S corporation as if it were a C corporation; (4) the tax rate is 21% (the corporate rate); (5) net recognized built-in gain is limited to the total net unrealized built-in gain at conversion (a ceiling amount); (6) the §1374 tax reduces the amount passed through to shareholders; (7) NOL carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards, and business credit carryforwards from C corporation years can offset the BIG tax.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §1368(b), for S corporations with NO accumulated E&P (i.e., the corporation has always been an S corporation or all C corporation E&P has been distributed): (1) distributions are nontaxable to the extent of the shareholder\'s stock basis — the basis is reduced but not below zero; (2) any distribution in excess of stock basis is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of stock — typically long-term capital gain if the stock has been held for more than one year. This is simpler than the rules for S corporations WITH accumulated E&P from C corporation years, where the distribution is ordered: (a) AAA (nontaxable return of basis), (b) accumulated E&P (taxable dividend), (c) remaining AAA, and (d) return of capital/capital gain per §1368(c).',

      'Only through distributions',
      'Minimum wage only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The IRS closely scrutinizes S corporation compensation because of employment tax implications: (1) S corporation income that flows through to the shareholder on Schedule K-1 is NOT subject to self-employment tax (unlike partnership/sole proprietorship income); (2) this creates an incentive to pay low salaries and take the remaining income as distributions (which avoid FICA/Medicare taxes); (3) the IRS requires that shareholder-employees be paid "reasonable compensation" — determined by comparable salaries for similar services in similar businesses, experience, hours worked, duties performed; (4) if compensation is unreasonably low, the IRS can reclassify distributions as wages, assess back employment taxes, penalties, and interest; (5) the corporation deducts the salary as a business expense, reducing the pass-through income. Key case: David E. Watson, P.C. v. United States (2012) — CPA\'s $24,000 salary on $200,000+ of income was unreasonable.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §6072(b), Form 1120-S is due on the 15th day of the 3rd month following the close of the tax year — March 15 for calendar-year S corporations (one month earlier than C corporation returns). An automatic 6-month extension to September 15 is available by filing Form 7004. This earlier deadline was established by the Surface Transportation Act of 2015 to align flow-through entity filing deadlines (partnerships: March 15, S corps: March 15) before individual returns (April 15), giving shareholders/partners time to receive their K-1 information. The S corporation issues Schedule K-1 to each shareholder showing their pro rata share of income, deductions, credits, and other items.',

      'The corporation earns too much income',
      'A shareholder sells stock to another eligible shareholder',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §1362(d), the S election terminates under three circumstances: (1) Voluntary revocation — shareholders holding more than 50% of shares consent to revoke (effective immediately or on a specified future date); (2) Ceasing to qualify — automatic termination when any §1361(b) requirement is violated: exceeding 100 shareholders, adding an ineligible shareholder (nonresident alien, partnership, C corporation — other than §401(a) or §501(c)(3) organizations), creating a second class of stock, becoming an ineligible corporation; (3) Passive investment income — if the S corporation has accumulated C corporation E&P and passive investment income exceeds 25% of gross receipts for 3 consecutive years.

      'The shareholder\'s stock basis only',
      'No limitations apply to S corporation losses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'S corporation losses are subject to three limitations applied sequentially: (1) BASIS limitation (§1366(d)) — losses can only reduce stock basis and debt basis (direct loans FROM the shareholder TO the corporation) to zero. Important: unlike partnerships, the shareholder\'s share of corporate-level debt to third parties does NOT increase basis. Excess losses are suspended and carried forward indefinitely until basis is restored. (2) AT-RISK limitation (§465) — losses are further limited to the amount the shareholder has "at risk" (amounts invested plus recourse debt for which the shareholder is personally liable). (3) PASSIVE ACTIVITY limitation (§469) — if the shareholder does not materially participate, losses are passive and can only offset passive income. Losses failing each test are suspended at that level. The order is critical: basis → at-risk → passive.',

      'The partnership always takes FMV basis in the contributed property',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §721, contributions of property to a partnership in exchange for a partnership interest are generally tax-free: (1) no gain or loss is recognized by the contributing partner or the partnership; (2) the partnership\'s basis in the contributed property = the partner\'s adjusted basis in the property (carryover basis under §723); (3) the contributing partner\'s basis in the partnership interest = the adjusted basis of the property contributed (substituted basis under §722); (4) the partnership\'s holding period for the contributed property includes the partner\'s pre-contribution holding period (§1223(2)).

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §705, a partner\'s outside basis is computed as follows: BEGINNING BASIS: initial contribution (property basis or cash contributed) or purchase price. INCREASES: (1) additional contributions; (2) pro rata share of partnership income (ordinary and separately stated); (3) pro rata share of tax-exempt income; (4) increase in share of partnership liabilities (§752 — treated as a deemed contribution). DECREASES: (1) distributions (cash and property basis); (2) pro rata share of partnership losses and deductions; (3) pro rata share of nondeductible, noncapital expenses; (4) decrease in share of partnership liabilities (§752 — treated as a deemed distribution). Critical difference from S corporations: partnership liabilities (including nonrecourse debt under Reg. §1.752) increase the partner\'s outside basis, allowing deduction of a greater amount of losses.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §707(c), guaranteed payments are payments to a partner for services or use of capital that are determined without regard to the partnership\'s income (i.e., they are fixed or minimum amounts). Tax treatment: (1) for the partnership — deductible as an ordinary business expense in computing partnership ordinary income (reducing the income allocated to all partners); (2) for the receiving partner — included in gross income as ordinary income in the partner\'s tax year that includes the end of the partnership\'s tax year in which the partnership deducted the payment; (3) guaranteed payments are subject to self-employment tax (SECA) for the receiving partner; (4) guaranteed payments are NOT distributions — they do not reduce the partner\'s outside basis directly (though the partnership\'s reduced income does reduce basis through the normal allocation mechanism).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §731(a)(1), gain is recognized on a current (non-liquidating) distribution ONLY when cash received exceeds the partner\'s outside basis. The gain is capital gain (from the deemed sale of the partnership interest). Key rules: (1) if cash ≤ basis: no gain, basis is reduced by the cash received; (2) if cash > basis: gain = cash received minus basis, basis is reduced to zero; (3) loss is NEVER recognized on a current distribution (losses can only be recognized in liquidating distributions, and only when the partner receives only cash, unrealized receivables, and inventory); (4) marketable securities may be treated as cash under §731(c).

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The §754 election is an annual election (binding for all subsequent years unless revoked with IRS consent) that triggers two types of inside basis adjustments: (1) §743(b) adjustment — when a partnership interest is transferred by sale, exchange, or death, the partnership adjusts the basis of its assets with respect to the transferee partner to reflect the difference between the transferee\'s outside basis (purchase price or FMV at death) and the transferee\'s share of the partnership\'s inside basis in its assets. This prevents the new partner from being taxed on built-in gain already paid for; (2) §734(b) adjustment — when a distribution results in gain recognition to the distributee partner (cash > basis) or a basis increase/decrease in distributed property, the partnership adjusts the basis of its remaining assets. These are PARTNER-SPECIFIC adjustments under §743(b) — they affect only the specific partner, not the other partners.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §704(b) and Reg. §1.704-1(b), special allocations must have "substantial economic effect" to be respected. This requires: (1) Economic effect — the allocation must be reflected in the partners\' capital accounts, liquidating distributions must be made in accordance with positive capital account balances, and partners with deficit capital accounts must be obligated to restore them (or meet the "alternate test" with a qualified income offset); (2) Substantiality — the allocation must have a reasonable possibility of substantially affecting the dollar amounts received by the partners independent of tax consequences. An allocation is NOT substantial if: (a) the net changes in capital accounts for all partners are the same with or without the allocation (overall tax effect test); (b) the allocation is designed to shift tax benefits among partners without affecting their economic arrangement (shifting or transitory allocations).

NONRECOURSE liabilities: (1) allocated in three tiers: (a) §704(c) minimum gain from contributed property; (b) partnership minimum gain; (c) profit-sharing ratio.

    explanation: 'Under §741, the sale of a partnership interest produces capital gain or loss, BUT §751(a) requires recharacterization to ordinary income to the extent of "hot assets": (1) Hot assets include: (a) unrealized receivables — accounts receivable of a cash-basis partnership, §1245/§1250 recapture potential, and other items that would produce ordinary income if collected; (b) substantially appreciated inventory — inventory items with FMV exceeding 120% of the partnership\'s basis in the inventory; (2) the portion of gain attributable to the selling partner\'s share of hot assets is ordinary income; (3) the remaining gain is capital; (4) the amount realized includes the buyer\'s assumption of the selling partner\'s share of partnership liabilities (§752(d)); (5) if a §754 election is in effect, the partnership adjusts the inside basis of its assets under §743(b) to reflect the transferee\'s purchase price.',

      'Subject to FICA withholding',
      'Subject to Social Security tax only',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §1402(a), general partners are subject to self-employment tax (SECA) on: (1) their distributive share of partnership ordinary business income (net of deductions); and (2) guaranteed payments for services. The self-employment tax consists of: Social Security tax (12.4% up to the wage base — $168,600 in 2024) and Medicare tax (2.9%, plus the 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax on earned income over $200,000 single/$250,000 MFJ). Key distinctions: (a) LIMITED partners are generally NOT subject to SECA on their distributive share (§1402(a)(13)) — only guaranteed payments for services are subject to SECA; (b) S corporation shareholders are NOT subject to SECA on pass-through income (only wages/salary); (c) rental income and portfolio income allocated to a partner are NOT subject to SECA.',

      'Any year the partners choose',
      'The year the partnership was formed',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §706(b), a partnership must adopt a tax year determined by a tiered approach: (1) Majority interest year — the tax year of partners owning more than 50% of partnership capital and profits (if they have the same year-end); (2) if no majority interest year exists — the year of all "principal partners" (partners with 5%+ interest); (3) if principal partners have different years — the year that results in the "least aggregate deferral" (a mathematical calculation); (4) §444 election — the partnership may elect a fiscal year that produces no more than 3 months of deferral, but must make required payments (§7519) — essentially an interest-free deposit with the IRS. This rule prevents income deferral by using a partnership year-end different from the partners\' year-end. Form 1065 is due on March 15 (for calendar-year partnerships).',

      'The partnership has overall losses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §731(a)(2), loss recognition in LIQUIDATING distributions is very limited: (1) the partner may recognize a loss ONLY IF the distribution consists SOLELY of: (a) cash; (b) unrealized receivables; and (c) inventory items; (2) the loss equals the excess of the partner\'s outside basis over the sum of cash received plus the basis of the unrealized receivables and inventory (which take a carryover basis, not to exceed the partner\'s remaining basis); (3) the loss is capital in character (long-term if the interest was held more than one year); (4) if ANY other property is received (real estate, equipment, securities, etc.), no loss can be recognized — instead, the partner\'s remaining basis is allocated to the non-cash property under §732(b) and (c), potentially creating deferred gain/loss. This contrasts with current distributions where loss is NEVER recognized.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The AAA is a corporate-level account (not shareholder-specific) that tracks cumulative S corporation income: (1) PURPOSE — identifies distributions that are from previously-taxed S corporation income (tax-free) versus accumulated C corporation E&P (taxable dividends); (2) INCREASES — S corporation ordinary income and separately stated income items (but NOT tax-exempt income — that goes to OAA, the Other Adjustments Account); (3) DECREASES — distributions, losses and deductions, nondeductible expenses (but NOT federal taxes related to C corporation years); (4) AAA CAN go negative (unlike stock basis, which cannot go below zero); (5) AAA is CRITICAL for S corporations with accumulated E&P from prior C corporation years — the distribution ordering rules under §1368(c) allocate distributions first to AAA, then to accumulated E&P, then to remaining AAA, then to stock basis/capital gain.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §1366(a), certain items must be separately stated because they may affect each shareholder\'s tax return differently: (1) capital gains and losses (short-term and long-term) — subject to individual capital loss limitations; (2) §1231 gains and losses — subject to netting at the individual level; (3) charitable contributions — subject to individual percentage limitations; (4) tax-exempt interest — increases basis but is not taxable; (5) foreign taxes paid — may be credited or deducted at the shareholder level; (6) portfolio income (interest, dividends) — for investment interest deduction limitation; (7) §179 deduction — subject to individual dollar and income limits; (8) rental income/loss — for passive activity rules.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under §706(d), when a partner\'s interest varies during the year: (1) the partnership must allocate income for the year between the varying interests; (2) two methods are available: (a) Interim closing of the books — the partnership\'s books are closed on the date of the change, and actual income for each period is allocated based on ownership during that period; (b) Proration method — the partnership\'s annual income is allocated pro rata by days, and each partner receives their share based on their ownership percentage during the applicable days; (3) "extraordinary items" (such as capital gains from asset sales) must be allocated to the day they occur, even if the proration method is otherwise used; (4) this prevents manipulation of income allocation through timing of interest transfers.',

      'S corporations cannot have employees',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The fundamental difference is tax structure: S corporations: (1) pass-through entity — income is reported on shareholders\' individual returns via Schedule K-1; (2) generally no entity-level tax (exceptions: BIG tax, passive investment income tax, LIFO recapture); (3) single level of taxation — income taxed at individual rates (up to 37%, but eligible for 20% QBI deduction under §199A). C corporations: (1) separate taxable entity — income taxed at the corporate level at 21%; (2) dividends are taxed again at the shareholder level (0%/15%/20% qualified dividend rate); (3) maximum combined tax rate on distributed earnings: 21% + (79% × 23.8%) = approximately 39.8%. Other differences: S corps cannot have more than 100 shareholders, can have only one class of stock, and have restrictions on shareholder types. C corps have no such restrictions.',

    explanation: 'Under §732(a), in a current (non-liquidating) distribution of property: (1) the partner\'s basis in the distributed property = the lesser of: (a) the partnership\'s adjusted basis in the property (carryover basis), or (b) the partner\'s remaining outside basis (after reducing for any cash received in the same transaction); (2) the partner\'s outside basis is then reduced by the basis assigned to the distributed property; (3) the partner\'s outside basis can never go below zero; (4) gain is recognized ONLY if cash exceeds basis; (5) loss is NEVER recognized in a current distribution. Example: partner has $30,000 outside basis, receives property with partnership basis of $50,000 → partner takes basis of $30,000 in the property (limited by remaining outside basis), and outside basis becomes zero.',
