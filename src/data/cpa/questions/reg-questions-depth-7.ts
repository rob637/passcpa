    question: 'Which of the following is a requirement for filing a consolidated federal income tax return?',
    options: [
      'The parent must own at least 51% of the voting stock of each subsidiary',
      'The parent must own at least 80% of the total voting power and 80% of the total value of the stock of each includible corporation',
      'All member corporations must be in the same line of business',
      'The parent must own 100% of the subsidiary',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1504(a), an affiliated group eligible to file a consolidated return requires the common parent to own (directly or indirectly) at least 80% of the total voting power AND at least 80% of the total value of the stock of each includible corporation. Certain corporations are excluded from the affiliated group, including tax-exempt organizations, S corporations, foreign corporations, and insurance companies (other than life).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under Treas. Reg. §1.1502-13, gain or loss on intercompany transactions within a consolidated group is deferred (not permanently eliminated) until a triggering event occurs. Triggering events include: (1) the property is sold outside the group, (2) the member holding the property leaves the group, (3) the property is used in a manner that creates a difference in treatment. The matching rule ensures the consolidated group is treated as a single entity — intercompany items are taken into account to produce the same result as if the transaction occurred between divisions of a single corporation.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under Treas. Reg. §1.704-1(b)(2), "economic effect" requires: (1) capital accounts maintained under the regulations, (2) liquidating distributions made in accordance with positive capital account balances, and (3) either a deficit restoration obligation (DRO) or compliance with the "alternate test" (qualified income offset). Partners do NOT need to share profits and losses equally — that is the whole point of special allocations. The "substantial" prong requires that the allocation must have a reasonable possibility of affecting the dollar amounts received by the partners (i.e., it cannot be a mere tax avoidance device with no real economic consequence).',

    explanation: 'Under IRC §531, the accumulated earnings tax is imposed at a rate of 20% on accumulated taxable income. This penalty tax applies to corporations that accumulate earnings beyond the reasonable needs of the business to avoid the individual income tax on dividends. A corporation is allowed an accumulated earnings credit of $250,000 ($150,000 for personal service corporations) — earnings accumulated up to this amount are presumed reasonable.

Subpart F income includes: foreign base company sales income, foreign base company services income, insurance income, and foreign personal holding company income (dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and capital gains).

      '50%',

    explanation: 'Under IRC §250, a domestic corporation that includes GILTI in gross income is allowed a deduction equal to 50% of its GILTI inclusion (for tax years beginning after 2025, this decreases to 37.5%). Combined with the 21% corporate tax rate, this results in an effective tax rate of 10.5% on GILTI (21% × 50% = 10.5%). The GILTI amount is roughly the CFC\'s income exceeding a 10% return on qualified business asset investment (QBAI). A foreign tax credit of 80% of foreign taxes attributable to GILTI is also available under §960.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §751, "hot assets" include unrealized receivables and inventory items (substantially appreciated). When a partner sells or exchanges a partnership interest, the amount of gain or loss attributable to hot assets is treated as ordinary income rather than capital gain. Unrealized receivables include items that would produce ordinary income if sold (including §1245/1250 recapture). Inventory items include assets held primarily for sale to customers and any other non-capital, non-§1231 assets.

Reg. §1.1502-21(c), the SRLY (Separate Return Limitation Year) rules limit the use of a subsidiary\'s pre-acquisition NOLs to offset only the subsidiary\'s own income contribution to the consolidated group\'s taxable income. This prevents a profitable group from acquiring a loss corporation solely to absorb the target\'s NOLs. The SRLY limitation works in tandem with §382 limitations — if a §382 ownership change occurs in connection with joining the group, the SRLY rules overlap and generally §382 applies instead (the "overlap rule" of Treas.

    explanation: 'Under IRC §731(a)(2), in a liquidating distribution, a loss is recognized ONLY if: (1) the distribution consists solely of cash, unrealized receivables, and/or inventory items, AND (2) the total amount distributed is less than the partner\'s outside basis. If any other property is distributed (e.g., equipment, real estate), loss cannot be recognized — instead, the basis of the distributed property is adjusted under §732(b) to equal the partner\'s remaining outside basis (substituted basis). The recognized loss is treated as a loss from the sale of a partnership interest (capital loss under §741, subject to §751 ordinary income recharacterization).',

    question: 'After an ownership change under IRC §382, the annual limitation on the use of pre-change NOLs is calculated as:',
    options: [
      'The total NOL divided by 20 years',
      'The value of the loss corporation\'s stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate',
      '50% of the corporation\'s annual taxable income',
      'The lesser of $10 million or the pre-change NOL',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §382, when there is an ownership change (more than 50 percentage point increase in ownership by 5% shareholders during a 3-year testing period), the annual §382 limitation = FMV of the loss corporation\'s stock immediately before the change × the long-term tax-exempt rate. This limits the amount of pre-change NOLs that can offset post-change income each year. If the loss corporation has a net unrealized built-in gain, the limitation may be increased by recognized built-in gains. If the corporation does not continue its business enterprise for 2 years after the change, the limitation drops to zero.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1367 and Treas. Reg. §1.1367-1(f), the S corporation shareholder stock basis is adjusted annually in the following order: (1) INCREASE for income items (ordinary income, separately stated income, tax-exempt income), (2) DECREASE for distributions, (3) DECREASE for nondeductible, noncapital expenses, and (4) DECREASE for deductible losses and deductions. This ordering is important because it maximizes the shareholder\'s ability to receive tax-free distributions and deduct losses (income increases basis first, creating more room for distributions and loss deductions).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §4958, when a disqualified person (officers, directors, key employees, substantial contributors) receives an excess benefit from a §501(c)(3) or §501(c)(4) organization, the following excise taxes apply: (1) First-tier tax: 25% of the excess benefit, imposed on the disqualified person, (2) Second-tier tax: 200% of the excess benefit if not corrected within the taxable period, (3) Organization managers who knowingly approve the transaction face a 10% tax (up to $20,000 per transaction).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §302(b), a stock redemption is treated as a sale or exchange (capital gain/loss treatment) rather than a dividend if it meets any of these tests: (1) Substantially disproportionate — after the redemption, the shareholder owns less than 50% of total voting power AND the shareholder\'s percentage ownership of voting stock is less than 80% of what it was before; (2) Complete termination of interest — all stock is redeemed (family attribution under §318 may be waived); (3) Not essentially equivalent to a dividend — a meaningful reduction in the shareholder\'s proportionate interest (Reg. requires a "meaningful reduction" per Davis); (4) Partial liquidation (corporate-level test) for noncorporate shareholders.',

    explanation: 'Under IRC §482, the IRS has authority to allocate income, deductions, credits, and allowances among two or more organizations, trades, or businesses owned or controlled by the same interests if necessary to clearly reflect income or prevent tax evasion. The arm\'s length standard is the benchmark — transactions between related parties must be priced as if they occurred between unrelated parties dealing at arm\'s length. Transfer pricing methods include: comparable uncontrolled price (CUP), resale price, cost plus, comparable profits method (CPM), and profit split. Penalties of 20-40% apply for substantial/gross transfer pricing misstatements.',
