    question: 'On what date does the standard 3-year statute of limitations begin to run for a federal income tax return that was due April 15, 2024, but was filed early on March 1, 2024?',
    options: [
      'April 15, 2024 — the original due date, since early-filed returns are deemed filed on the due date',

      'October 15, 2024 — the extended due date',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §6501(b)(1), a return filed before the due date is treated as filed on the due date. Therefore, even though the return was filed on March 1, 2024, the 3-year statute of limitations begins on April 15, 2024 (the original due date). The IRS has until April 15, 2027, to assess additional tax. Late-filed returns start the clock on the actual filing date.',

When both apply simultaneously, the failure to file penalty is reduced by the failure to pay amount (so combined is 5% per month, not 5.5%). After 5 months, failure to file is maxed out. Key: failure to file penalty is TEN TIMES more expensive than failure to pay — always file even if you can\'t pay. Minimum failure to file penalty: lesser of $510 (2024) or 100% of tax due (for returns >60 days late).',
