When both apply simultaneously, the failure to file penalty is reduced by the failure to pay amount (so combined is 5% per month, not 5.5%). After 5 months, failure to file is maxed out. Key: failure to file penalty is TEN TIMES more expensive than failure to pay — always file even if you can\'t pay. Minimum failure to file penalty: lesser of $510 (2024) or 100% of tax due (for returns >60 days late).',
