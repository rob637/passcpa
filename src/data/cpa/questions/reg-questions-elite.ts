    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1014, inherited property takes a stepped-up basis to FMV at the date of death. Since the alternate valuation date was not elected, the basis is $45,000 (date of death FMV). Selling for $50,000 produces a capital gain of $50,000 − $45,000 = $5,000. The uncle\'s original basis of $15,000 is irrelevant due to the step-up. The holding period for inherited property is automatically long-term regardless of actual holding period.',

    question: 'A taxpayer\'s CPA prepared a return claiming a $40,000 deduction for a home office. The IRS disallowed $30,000 of the deduction, determining it had no substantial authority. The resulting understatement of tax is $7,500. What penalty may the IRS assess?',
    options: [
      'A 20% accuracy-related penalty of $1,500 on the substantial understatement under IRC §6662',
      'A 75% civil fraud penalty of $5,625 under IRC §6663',
      'No penalty because the taxpayer relied on a CPA',
      'A 5% negligence penalty of $375',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The accuracy-related penalty under IRC §6662 is 20% of the underpayment attributable to a substantial understatement of income tax. The understatement of $7,500 exceeds the greater of 10% of the correct tax or $5,000, making it substantial. The penalty is 20% × $7,500 = $1,500. Reliance on a CPA may provide a reasonable cause defense, but only if the taxpayer provided complete information and the CPA\'s advice had a realistic basis.',
