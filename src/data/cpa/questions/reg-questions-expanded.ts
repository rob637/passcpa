    question: 'In a limited partnership, the general partner contributed $50,000 and two limited partners each contributed $100,000. The partnership incurred a $180,000 loss in its first year. How is the loss allocated among the partners?',
    options: [

      'Entirely to the general partner since limited partners cannot share in losses',
      'Only to the limited partners since they contributed more capital',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Loss allocation in a limited partnership follows the partnership agreement. If the agreement is silent on loss allocation, the default rule under the Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (RULPA) allocates losses based on capital contribution ratios. The general partner\'s share would be $50,000/$250,000 × $180,000 = $36,000. Each limited partner\'s share = $100,000/$250,000 × $180,000 = $72,000.
