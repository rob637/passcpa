    question: 'A contractor offers to build a deck for a homeowner for $8,000. The homeowner responds by saying, \'I accept your offer, but the price must be $7,000.\' Under contract law, what is the legal effect of the homeowner\'s response?',
    options: [
      'The response is a counteroffer that terminates the original offer',
      'The response is an acceptance with an additional term',
      'The response is an acceptance of the $8,000 offer',
      'The response creates a binding contract at $7,500 (the midpoint)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under the mirror image rule of common law contracts, an acceptance must match the offer exactly. The homeowner\'s response changes a material term (price), making it a counteroffer rather than an acceptance. A counteroffer operates as a rejection of the original offer and terminates it. The contractor is now free to accept or reject the $7,000 counteroffer. Under the UCC (goods), different terms may not terminate the offer, but this is a services contract governed by common law.',

    question: 'An agent, authorized only to negotiate contracts on behalf of a principal, enters into a binding contract with a third party. The principal did not ratify the contract. What is the principal\'s liability?',
    options: [
      'The principal is not liable because the agent exceeded the scope of actual authority',
      'The principal is liable because negotiation authority implies contracting authority',
      'The principal is liable only if the agent received no compensation',
      'Both the principal and agent are equally liable on the contract',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'An agent binds a principal only when acting within the scope of actual or apparent authority. If the agent was authorized only to negotiate (not execute contracts), the agent exceeded their authority. The principal is not bound unless they ratify the contract. However, the agent may be personally liable to the third party for breach of implied warranty of authority.',

    question: 'A debtor defaults on a loan secured by equipment under Article 9 of the UCC. The secured creditor repossesses and sells the equipment at a commercially reasonable public sale for $35,000. The remaining debt after applying proceeds is $12,000. What is the debtor\'s obligation?',
    options: [
      'The debtor owes a deficiency judgment of $12,000 — the difference between the debt and sale proceeds',
      'The debtor owes nothing further since the creditor accepted the collateral',
      'The debtor owes $12,000 plus twice the credit service charge as a penalty',
      'The debtor owes the full original debt because the sale was involuntary',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under UCC Article 9, when a secured creditor disposes of collateral in a commercially reasonable manner, the proceeds are applied to the debt. If proceeds are insufficient, the debtor is liable for the deficiency — the remaining $12,000. The sale must be commercially reasonable, conducted after proper notice to the debtor. If the sale is not commercially reasonable, the debtor may challenge the deficiency amount.',
