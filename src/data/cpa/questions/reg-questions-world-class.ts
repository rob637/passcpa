    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'IRC §6694(a): Preparer penalty applies if position lacks substantial authority AND is not disclosed. If disclosed on Form 8275, the position must have at least a reasonable basis. For tax shelters, "more likely than not" standard applies regardless of disclosure.',

      '10 years from the filing date (April 15, 2031)',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §6501(e), if the taxpayer omits gross income exceeding 25% of the gross income stated on the return, the statute of limitations is extended from 3 years to 6 years. A 30% omission exceeds the 25% threshold, so the IRS has 6 years from the filing date (April 15, 2027) to assess additional tax.
