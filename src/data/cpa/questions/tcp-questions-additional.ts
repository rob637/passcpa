    question: 'A taxpayer works as a freelance graphic designer and also has a full-time job. The taxpayer earned $15,000 from freelance work and incurred $3,000 in ordinary and necessary business expenses. How should the net self-employment income be reported?',

    explanation: 'The fundamental difference: Traditional IRA contributions may be deductible (reducing current taxable income), but distributions in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRA contributions are not deductible, but qualified distributions (after age 59½ and 5-year holding period) are entirely tax-free. The annual IRA contribution limit is $7,000 (2024). The concept — current deduction vs. tax-free growth — is the key distinction.',
