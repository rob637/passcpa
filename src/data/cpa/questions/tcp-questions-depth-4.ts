For 2025, the amount is approximately $13.99 million ($27.98 million for married couples with portability). OBBBA made the increased exemption permanent.

Combined discounts of 25-40% are common. The IRS scrutinizes FLP arrangements under §2036 (retained interests) if the transferor retains too much control or use of transferred assets.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'When a C corporation converts to an S corporation, the built-in gains (BIG) tax under §1374 applies at the highest corporate rate (21%) on net recognized built-in gain if assets are disposed of within the recognition period (5 years).

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'S corporation shareholder-employees must pay themselves reasonable compensation for services rendered before taking distributions. Distributions from S corporations are not subject to FICA/self-employment tax, creating an incentive to minimize salary. The IRS can reclassify distributions as wages if compensation is unreasonably low (David E. Watson P.C. v. Commissioner).

      'The taxpayer must have earned income',
      'Investment income must be below the statutory threshold',
      'The taxpayer must have a qualifying child',
      'The taxpayer must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien for the entire year',

Requirements include: (1) earned income, (2) investment income ≤ $11,600 (2025), (3) valid SSN, (4) U.S. citizen/resident alien for the year, (5) not filing MFS (unless certain conditions met under ARPA), (6) not a qualifying child of another.

    question: 'The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) provides a maximum credit of $2,500 per eligible student. How much of this credit is refundable?',

      'None — the full credit is nonrefundable',
      '20% ($500)',
      '40% ($1,000)',
      '100% ($2,500)',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The AOTC (§25A(i)) provides 100% of the first $2,000 + 25% of the next $2,000 = $2,500 maximum per eligible student. 40% of the credit ($1,000) is refundable. Available for the first 4 years of postsecondary education. Phase-out: $80,000-$90,000 (single) / $160,000-$180,000 (MFJ). Student must be at least half-time.

    question: 'The penalty for failure to file a tax return under §6651(a)(1) is:',
    options: [
      '0.5% per month of the tax due, up to 25%',
      '5% per month of the tax due, up to 25%',
      '10% per month of the tax due, up to 50%',
      'A flat $500 per month',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The failure to file penalty is 5% of the unpaid tax per month (or fraction), up to 25%. The failure to pay penalty is 0.5% per month, up to 25%. When both apply simultaneously, the failure to file penalty is reduced by the failure to pay amount (net 4.5% + 0.5% = 5% per month for the first 5 months). After 5 months, the failure to pay penalty continues alone at 0.5%/month.',
