For 2025, the amount is approximately $13.99 million ($27.98 million for married couples with portability). OBBBA made the increased exemption permanent.

Combined discounts of 25-40% are common. The IRS scrutinizes FLP arrangements under §2036 (retained interests) if the transferor retains too much control or use of transferred assets.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'S corporation shareholder-employees must pay themselves reasonable compensation for services rendered before taking distributions. Distributions from S corporations are not subject to FICA/self-employment tax, creating an incentive to minimize salary. The IRS can reclassify distributions as wages if compensation is unreasonably low (David E. Watson P.C. v. Commissioner). Factors include: industry standards, training, experience, duties performed, and comparable salaries.',

    question: 'A taxpayer adopted a child in the current year and incurred $18,000 in qualified adoption expenses. The taxpayer\'s modified AGI is $210,000 (filing jointly). What is the adoption credit for 2024?',
    options: [
      'The maximum credit of $16,810 (2024 limit), subject to partial phaseout based on MAGI',
      '$18,000 — the full amount of qualified expenses',
      '$0 — the credit is not available for adoption',
      '$8,000 — half of expenses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The adoption credit under IRC §23 allows up to $16,810 (2024) per eligible child for qualified adoption expenses. The credit phases out for MAGI between $252,150 and $292,150 (2024) for MFJ. At $210,000 MAGI, the taxpayer is below the phaseout range, so the full credit of $16,810 applies (capped at the maximum, not the $18,000 paid). The credit is nonrefundable but can be carried forward for up to 5 years.',

When both apply simultaneously, the failure to file penalty is reduced by the failure to pay amount (net 4.5% + 0.5% = 5% per month for the first 5 months). After 5 months, the failure to pay penalty continues alone at 0.5%/month.',
