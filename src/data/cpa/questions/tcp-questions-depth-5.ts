    explanation: 'The standard deduction is adjusted annually for inflation. For 2025 the amount for single filers is $15,000 ($30,000 MFJ). Taxpayers age 65+ or blind get additional amounts ($1,950 for single/HOH, $1,550 for MFJ per qualifying spouse in 2025). The taxpayer claims the GREATER of the standard deduction or total itemized deductions (Schedule A). Key itemized deductions: state/local taxes (capped at $10,000 SALT), mortgage interest (acquisition debt up to $750K), charitable contributions, medical expenses (> 7.5% AGI). Dependents claimed on another\'s return have a limited standard deduction (greater of $1,350 or earned income + $450, capped at the regular standard deduction).',

Requirements: (1) Qualifying event: destruction, theft, seizure, condemnation, or threat of condemnation. (2) Replacement property: "similar or related in service or use" (narrower test than §1031\'s "like-kind" for most property; broader for condemnation of real property — uses like-kind standard).

Adjustment = outside basis of transferee − proportionate share of inside basis. Allocated among partnership assets under §755 (ordinary income assets first, then capital/§1231).

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'IRC §21 (Child and Dependent Care Credit): Nonrefundable credit (post-2021; was temporarily refundable for 2021 under ARPA). Qualifying expenses: care for qualifying individual(s) to enable the taxpayer to work/look for work. Qualifying individuals: child under 13, disabled spouse, or disabled dependent. Expense limits: $3,000 for one qualifying individual, $6,000 for two or more. Credit percentage: 35% (AGI ≤ $15,000) declining by 1% for each $2,000 of AGI above $15,000, to a floor of 20% (AGI > $43,000). Both spouses must have earned income (or one must be a full-time student or disabled). Employer-provided dependent care (§129): up to $5,000 excluded from income — reduces the expenses eligible for the credit. Cannot use for overnight camps. Must report care provider\'s TIN.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'IRC §511-§514 (UBIT): Three requirements for UBIT: (1) Trade or business, (2) Regularly carried on, (3) NOT substantially related to the organization\'s exempt purpose. Tax rates: regular corporate rates (21%) for exempt organizations that are corporations; trust rates for others. $1,000 specific deduction. Exclusions from UBI: dividends, interest, royalties, rents from real property (not personal property), capital gains, volunteer-run activities, activities for the convenience of members (hospital pharmacy for patients). Debt-financed income (§514): even excluded income becomes partially taxable if acquired with borrowed funds. Siloing requirement (post-TCJA): each unrelated trade/business must be reported separately (losses from one cannot offset income from another). Filing: Form 990-T.',

    options: [
      'The conversion is only allowed at age 59½',

      'No tax consequences arise',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'IRC §408A(d)(3): Roth IRA conversion: taxable event. The amount converted from traditional to Roth is included in ordinary income (to the extent it represents deductible contributions and earnings). The 10% early withdrawal penalty does NOT apply to conversions (but applies if converted amounts are withdrawn within 5 years and taxpayer is under 59½). No income limit for conversions (the income limit for conversion was eliminated in 2010). "Backdoor Roth" strategy: make nondeductible traditional IRA contribution → convert to Roth. Pro-rata rule (§408(d)(2)): if the taxpayer has ANY traditional IRA with pre-tax money, the conversion is taxed proportionally (cannot cherry-pick only after-tax money). Roth IRA: no RMDs during the owner\'s lifetime (Roth 401(k) RMDs eliminated by SECURE 2.0 starting 2024).',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'IRC §704(b) / Reg. §1.704-1(b): Partnership allocations: must have substantial economic effect (SEE) to be respected. Two-part test: (1) Economic effect: allocation must be consistent with the economic arrangement — requires (a) capital accounts maintained per §704(b) rules, (b) liquidating distributions based on capital accounts, (c) deficit restoration obligation (or qualified income offset as alternate). (2) Substantiality: the allocation must have a reasonable possibility of substantially affecting the dollar amounts to be received by the partners independent of tax consequences. If SEE is NOT met: allocations are recast according to Partners\' Interest in the Partnership (PIP) — the manner in which partners share the economic benefit or burden. Special allocations: commonly used for depreciation, credits, specific income items — must pass the SEE test.',

Result: capital loss (long-term if the holding period > 1 year as of December 31 of that year). Exception: §1244 small business stock — up to $50,000 ($100,000 MFJ) of loss is treated as ordinary loss (remainder is capital). Another exception: if the corporation is an affiliated subsidiary (80%+ owned) and > 90% of gross receipts were from active business: the loss is ordinary (not capital).
