Gambling losses: deductible as an itemized deduction on Schedule A — but ONLY to the extent of gambling winnings for the year. Netting is NOT allowed: if you win $5,000 and lose $8,000, you report $5,000 income and deduct $5,000 losses (not a net $0 or net $3,000 loss). Post-TCJA: the limitation also includes expenses incurred in connection with gambling activities (travel, entry fees). Professional gamblers: report on Schedule C but still limited to winnings (TCJA changed this — previously had more flexibility).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC §1374 (Built-In Gains Tax): Applies when: a C corp elects S status (or an S corp acquires assets from a C corp in a tax-free reorganization). Recognition period: 5 years (permanently set by PATH Act of 2015; was historically 10 years). Tax rate: 21% (highest corporate rate). Tax base: the lesser of (1) Net recognized built-in gain (gain on assets held at conversion date, net of recognized built-in losses), or (2) Taxable income as if the entity were a C corp. Carryforward: unused built-in gain can be triggered in subsequent recognition period years. NOLs from C corp years: can offset BIG tax. Items NOT subject to BIG tax: appreciation that occurred after the S election, assets acquired after conversion, cash-basis receivables (collected post-conversion, but not reflected in FMV at conversion).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC §1031 — Boot in like-kind exchanges: Boot = cash received + FMV of non-like-kind property received + net debt relief (liabilities assumed by the other party exceeding liabilities the taxpayer assumes). Gain recognized = the lesser of (1) boot received, or (2) realized gain. Losses are NEVER recognized in a §1031 exchange (even with boot). Basis of property received: basis of property given up + gain recognized − boot received (simplified). Mortgage netting: if taxpayer is relieved of a $100K mortgage but takes on a $60K mortgage, net boot = $40K (debt relief). Boot given (cash paid) reduces gain recognition. Post-TCJA (2018+): §1031 applies ONLY to real property (personal property exchanges no longer qualify). Must identify replacement property within 45 days, close within 180 days.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC §751 (Hot Assets): On sale of partnership interest: gain/loss attributable to §751 property is ordinary income/loss, not capital. §751 property: (1) Unrealized receivables: rights to payment for goods/services not yet included in income PLUS §1245/§1250 recapture potential. (2) Inventory: substantially appreciated inventory (FMV > 120% of basis) — technically, for sales of partnership interests, ALL inventory is §751 (the 120% threshold applies only to distributions). Calculation: determine the partner\'s share of §751 gain (as if the partnership sold all assets at FMV at the moment of the sale) → that portion is ordinary. Remaining gain: capital gain (long-term if held > 1 year). §751(b) applies to disproportionate distributions — more complex analysis of exchanges between ordinary and capital asset classes.',

Pre-TCJA percentages were 70%/80%/100% — reduced to 50%/65%/100% by TCJA to align with lower corporate rate. Limitation: DRD generally cannot exceed the same percentage of taxable income (computed without the DRD, NOL deduction, and capital loss carryback). Exception: if applying the limitation creates or increases an NOL, the limitation does not apply (take the full DRD).

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'IRC §71/§215 (repealed by TCJA for post-2018 agreements): Pre-2019 divorce/separation agreements: alimony is deductible by the payor (above-the-line) and includable in the recipient\'s gross income. Post-2018 agreements (executed after 12/31/2018): alimony has NO tax consequence — NOT deductible by payor, NOT income to recipient. Modifications: if a pre-2019 agreement is modified after 2018 AND the modification expressly provides that the TCJA rules apply → new rules govern. Child support: NEVER deductible by payor, never income to recipient (regardless of when). Alimony recapture (pre-2019): if alimony payments decrease significantly in the first 3 years, excess is recaptured (§71(f)). Front-loading rules prevent disguising property settlements as alimony.',

(3) "Dual basis" situation: if FMV < donor\'s basis AND donee sells between FMV and donor\'s basis → no gain or loss ("gap" rule). Gift tax paid may increase basis proportionally (§1015(d)).
