Carryforward: indefinite (no expiration — was 20 years pre-TCJA). 80% limitation: NOLs arising after 2017 can offset only 80% of taxable income (the remaining 20% is always taxable). Pre-TCJA NOLs: not subject to the 80% limit (retain 100% offset). Ordering: pre-2018 NOLs used first (since they expire AND have 100% offset). NOL calculation for individuals: start with negative taxable income, add back nonbusiness deductions exceeding nonbusiness income, add back personal exemption, add back the NOL deduction itself (no circular deduction). Farming losses: special 2-year carryback still available. Insurance companies: special rules.',

Liquidating distributions: (1) Cash: same rule — gain if cash > outside basis. (2) Property: basis = partner\'s remaining outside basis (substituted basis, not carryover). (3) Loss can be recognized: only if ONLY cash, unrealized receivables, and inventory are distributed and total is less than outside basis. §732(d): optional basis adjustment for property received within 2 years of acquiring partnership interest. §737: gain on distribution of contributed property within 7 years.',

    correctAnswer: 1,

Must be included in income annually as it accrues (constant yield method) — similar to earning interest without receiving cash. Constant yield method: OID accrual = (adjusted issue price × yield to maturity) − qualified stated interest for the period. Result: OID accrual increases each year (front-loaded for discount). Effect on basis: OID included in income increases the holder\'s adjusted basis. De minimis OID: if OID < 0.25% × stated redemption price × number of complete years to maturity → treated as zero (instead recognized as capital gain at maturity/sale). Exceptions: (1) Tax-exempt bonds: OID is tax-exempt but reduces capital gain on sale. (2) Short-term obligations (≤ 1 year): OID can be deferred until maturity/sale (for non-accrual taxpayers). (3) US Savings Bonds: election to defer reporting. Issuer: deducts OID on the same accrual schedule.',

PTET workaround: many states enacted "pass-through entity taxes" (PTET) where the entity (partnership/S corp) pays state tax → entity-level deduction NOT limited by the SALT cap → benefits flow to owners. Foreign real property taxes: NOT deductible at all (TCJA eliminated this deduction entirely — §164(b)(6)(B)). Business SALT: not limited (Schedule C, rental properties, etc. — the cap applies only to personal/itemized deductions). The $10,000 cap was one of the most significant TCJA changes for high-tax-state residents.',

Must elect nonrecognition (election statement with return). If replacement not made within the period: file amended return for the year of conversion to recognize gain.

Does NOT apply to: transfers to nonresident alien spouses (unless special election under §1041(d)). Depreciation: any recapture potential carries over to the transferee spouse.
