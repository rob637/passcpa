    explanation: 'The IRS may accept an offer in compromise on three bases: (1) doubt as to liability — genuine dispute about the correct tax, (2) doubt as to collectibility — taxpayer\'s assets and income are less than the full liability, and (3) effective tax administration — no doubt about liability or collectibility, but exceptional circumstances make full payment inequitable.',

    question: 'A taxpayer converts $200,000 from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. The traditional IRA consists of $150,000 in deductible contributions and earnings, and $50,000 in nondeductible contributions. What amount is included in the taxpayer\'s gross income?',
    options: [
      '$200,000',
      '$150,000',
      '$50,000',
      '$0 — conversions are tax-free',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Roth conversions are taxable events. The taxable portion equals the total conversion minus the nontaxable basis (nondeductible contributions). With $50,000 of nondeductible contributions forming the basis: $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000 taxable. Note: the pro-rata rule under §408(d)(2) applies when the taxpayer has multiple traditional IRAs.',
