    options: [
      '30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI) using EBITDA basis',
      '30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI) using EBIT basis',
      '50% of adjusted taxable income',
      '100% of business interest income plus 30% of ATI',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Post-2021, the 163(j) limitation uses EBIT (not EBITDA) - depreciation/amortization can no longer be added back to ATI. Limit = business interest income + 30% of ATI. Note: H.R. 1 may restore EBITDA basis for July 2026+ testing.',
