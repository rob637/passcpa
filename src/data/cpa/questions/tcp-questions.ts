    question: 'A single taxpayer earned $85,000 in wages and received $3,200 in qualified dividends during the current year. The taxpayer also paid $2,200 in student loan interest. What is the taxpayer\'s adjusted gross income (AGI)?',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'AGI = gross income minus above-the-line deductions. Gross income includes wages ($85,000) and qualified dividends ($3,200) = $88,200. The student loan interest deduction (up to $2,500) is an above-the-line deduction. The taxpayer paid $2,200, which is below the $2,500 maximum, so the full $2,200 is deductible. AGI = $88,200 − $2,200 = $86,000. Qualified dividends are included in gross income but taxed at preferential capital gain rates when computing tax liability.',
