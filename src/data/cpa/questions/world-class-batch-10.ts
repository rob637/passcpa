      'Separated and reported as prior period costs',
      'Combined with current period costs before computing unit costs',
      'Allocated entirely to completed units',

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Weighted-average combines beginning WIP costs with current costs, then divides by equivalent units (beginning partial + started and completed + ending partial). FIFO separates layers. Weighted-average is simpler but less precise for cost control.',

      'Operating cash flow exceeds reported net income',
      'Aggressive revenue recognition policies are used'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'High earnings quality means earnings are sustainable, backed by cash, and not reliant on accounting gimmicks. Operating cash flow exceeding net income suggests strong cash generation. The opposite (high accruals) may indicate lower quality.',
