    question: 'Piper Corp. has 500,000 shares of $2 par common stock outstanding. At the beginning of the year, additional paid-in capital was $3 million and retained earnings were $4.5 million.

    explanation: 'A stock dividend (whether small or large) does not change total stockholders\' equity — it merely reclassifies amounts within equity. For a small stock dividend (<20-25%), the entry debits Retained Earnings at market value (50,000 shares × $25 = $1,250,000) and credits Common Stock at par (50,000 × $2 = $100,000) and APIC ($1,150,000).
