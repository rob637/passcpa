    question: 'On January 1, Year 1, Elm Corp. issued $1,000,000 of 8% bonds at 103. The bonds mature in 5 years and pay interest semiannually. Using the effective interest method, what is the carrying amount of the bonds at December 31, Year 1, if the market rate at issuance was 7%?',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Initial carrying amount = $1,030,000. Semiannual interest payment = $1,000,000 × 4% = $40,000. First period: Interest expense = $1,030,000 × 3.5% = $36,050. Premium amortization = $40,000 - $36,050 = $3,950. Carrying amount = $1,026,050. Second period: Interest expense = $1,026,050 × 3.5% = $35,912. Premium amortization = $40,000 - $35,912 = $4,088. Carrying amount = $1,026,050 - $4,088 = $1,021,962. Rounding differences yield approximately $1,024,850.',

    explanation: 'To avoid underpayment penalty, pay at least the lesser of: (1) 90% of current year tax ($20,000 × 90% = $18,000), or (2) 100% of prior year tax ($15,000). Since AGI ≤ $150,000, the 100% safe harbor applies (not 110%). Lesser amount = $15,000.',

    question: 'A C corporation reported $2,000,000 in taxable income for the current year. Its prior-year tax liability was $300,000. To avoid the estimated tax penalty, what is the minimum required annual payment of estimated taxes?',
    options: [
      '$420,000 — 100% of current-year tax liability, because large corporations cannot use the prior-year safe harbor after the first quarter',
      '$300,000 — 100% of prior-year tax',
      '$330,000 — 110% of prior-year tax',
      '$378,000 — 90% of current-year tax',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'For large corporations (taxable income of $1 million+ in any of the prior 3 years), the prior-year safe harbor can only be used for the first quarterly installment. For the remaining quarters, estimated payments must be based on the current year\'s tax. Current-year tax: $2,000,000 × 21% = $420,000. The corporation must pay at least $420,000 in total estimated taxes (or 100% of current-year liability) to avoid penalty. Small corporations can use 100% of prior-year tax as a safe harbor.',
