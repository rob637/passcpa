    question: 'A donor establishes a charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT) naming a not-for-profit as the remainder beneficiary. The trust assets have a fair value of $1,000,000, and actuarial calculations determine the NPO\'s remainder interest at $650,000. The annuity payments to the income beneficiary begin immediately.

      'Define clear classification criteria with data owner accountability',
      'Allow users to self-classify their own data without oversight',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Effective data classification requires clear criteria defining each classification level, combined with data owner accountability for applying classifications correctly. Over-classification (all confidential) wastes resources, user self-classification without oversight leads to inconsistency, and purely automated tools miss context. A governance framework with defined criteria and owner responsibility is most effective.',

    options: [
      'Follow the shortest retention period to minimize data exposure',

      'Delete all data after 7 years as a standard practice',
      'Follow the longest applicable retention period for each data type',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'When multiple retention requirements apply to the same data, organizations must follow the longest applicable period to avoid regulatory violations. Deleting data too early could violate regulations requiring longer retention. However, once the longest period expires, data should be destroyed to minimize risk. Indefinite retention creates unnecessary risk and may violate data minimization principles.',

    question: 'An S corporation converted from C corporation status five years ago. At conversion, it held land with FMV of $2,000,000 and basis of $500,000. This year, the land is sold for $2,500,000. What is the built-in gains tax consequence?',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'The built-in gains (BIG) tax recognition period is 5 years post-TCJA (reduced from 10 years). Since exactly 5 years have passed, the sale occurs within the recognition period. The BIG tax applies to the lesser of: (1) recognized built-in gain ($1,500,000 FMV at conversion minus $500,000 basis) or (2) taxable income. Post-conversion appreciation ($500,000) is not subject to BIG tax.',

    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'AAA is calculated: Beginning $100,000 + Income $80,000 - Deductions $10,000 = $170,000 before distributions. Distributions reduce AAA but not below zero. Distributable AAA = $170,000, but only $120,000 was distributed. Ending AAA = $170,000 - $120,000 = $50,000.

Key factors include: contingent payments based on profits, interest rates significantly above market, subordination, lack of repayment dates. A shareholder loan with above-market interest and profit-based contingent payments resembles preferred stock and could terminate S status.',
