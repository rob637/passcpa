    question: 'West Corp. is defendant in a lawsuit. Legal counsel advises that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss will be between $500,000 and $800,000, with no amount more likely than another. How much should West accrue?',

    explanation: 'Under ASC 450, when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable, accrue the loss. When the estimate is a range with no amount more likely, accrue the MINIMUM of the range ($500,000). The remaining exposure ($300,000) should be disclosed in the notes.',
