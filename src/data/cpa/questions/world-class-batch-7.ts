    explanation: 'Cash collected = Sales - Increase in A/R = $800,000 - ($75,000 - $60,000) = $800,000 - $15,000 = $785,000. An increase in A/R means not all sales were collected in cash.',

    question: 'Investor Co. acquires 30% of Investee for $1,000,000. Investee\'s book value is $2,500,000 at acquisition. The excess over book value is attributable to equipment with a 10-year remaining life. In Year 1, Investee reports income of $400,000 and pays dividends of $100,000.

    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under the equity method, Investor recognizes 30% of Investee\'s income less amortization of excess cost. Investment cost $1,000,000 − 30% of book value ($750,000) = $250,000 excess attributable to equipment. Annual amortization = $250,000 ÷ 10 years = $25,000. Investment income = (30% × $400,000) − $25,000 = $120,000 − $25,000 = $95,000. Dividends received ($30,000 = 30% × $100,000) reduce the investment account but do not affect income recognition.',

Debt adjustment (loss because FV increased): Actually, if debt FV decreased, the company records a gain (favorable borrowing position).
