    question: 'Willow Corp. enters into a lease for equipment with a fair value of $500,000. The lease term is 8 years, and the equipment has an economic life of 10 years. Annual lease payments are $70,000 at the end of each year. The lessee\'s incremental borrowing rate is 6%. The present value of the lease payments is $438,000. How should the lessee classify this lease?',
    options: [
      'Operating lease because the present value is less than 90% of fair value',
      'Finance lease because the lease term exceeds 75% of the economic life',
      'Operating lease because there is no transfer of ownership',
      'Finance lease because it contains a bargain purchase option'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842, a lease is classified as a finance lease if it meets ANY of the five criteria: (1) transfer of ownership, (2) bargain purchase option, (3) lease term ≥ 75% of economic life, (4) PV of payments ≥ 90% of fair value, or (5) specialized asset. Here, the lease term (8 years) is 80% of economic life (10 years), exceeding the 75% threshold. This alone makes it a finance lease.',

    question: 'A lessee has an existing operating lease with 4 years remaining and a right-of-use asset of $200,000 and lease liability of $220,000. The lease is modified to extend the term by 2 years with an additional $50,000 annual payment. How should the lessee account for this modification?',
    options: [
      'Recognize a new right-of-use asset and write off the existing one',
      'Remeasure the lease liability and adjust the right-of-use asset by the same amount',
      'Record the modification as a separate new lease',
      'Expense the modification costs immediately'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under ASC 842-10-25-8, when an operating lease is modified and not accounted for as a separate contract, the lessee remeasures the lease liability using a revised discount rate and adjusts the right-of-use asset by the corresponding amount. The modification is not a separate lease because additional right-of-use was not granted at a stand-alone price.',

    question: 'Pine Inc. owns 80% of Spruce Corp. During the year, Spruce reported net income of $500,000 and declared dividends of $100,000. At acquisition, Spruce had identifiable net assets with a fair value of $2,000,000 and a book value of $1,800,000. The excess was attributable to equipment with a 5-year remaining life. What is the noncontrolling interest share of Spruce\'s net income for the year?',
    options: [
      '$100,000',
      '$92,000',
      '$80,000',
      '$108,000'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'First calculate excess amortization: ($2,000,000 - $1,800,000) ÷ 5 = $40,000 annual. Adjusted net income: $500,000 - $40,000 = $460,000. NCI share (20%): $460,000 × 20% = $92,000.

      'All expenditures are recognized when the liability is incurred',
      'Depreciation expense is recorded for capital assets'
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under modified accrual, revenues are recognized when measurable and available. "Available" typically means collectible within 60 days (though some governments use longer periods). Unlike full accrual, revenues must be both earned AND collectible within the availability period. Capital assets are not depreciated in governmental funds.',

    explanation: 'A material weakness exists when there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Lack of segregation of duties over $5M in payments (10% of total) involving initiation, approval, AND recording creates a reasonable possibility of material misstatement and fraud, constituting a material weakness.',
