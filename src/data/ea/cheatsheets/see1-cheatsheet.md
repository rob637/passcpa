2. **HOH**: Must pay > 50% of home costs (not just live there)
3. **QC age**: 19 general, 24 for students, no limit if disabled
4. **Alimony**: Pre-2019 = income; Post-2018 = nothing
5. **Municipal interest**: Excluded but may affect other calculations
6. **Kiddie tax**: Unearned > $2,600 taxed at parent's rate
7. **First-time homebuyer**: IRA exception is $10,000 LIFETIME
8. **Estimated payments**: 110% safe harbor if AGI > $150K

## Mnemonics
