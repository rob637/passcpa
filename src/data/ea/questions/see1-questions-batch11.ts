    question: 'Taxpayer Rodriguez, age 62, began taking distributions from a Roth IRA established 3 years ago with regular contributions. Rodriguez withdrew $15,000, of which $12,000 represents contributions and $3,000 represents earnings. What are the tax consequences?',
    options: [
      'The $12,000 in contributions is tax-free; the $3,000 in earnings is taxable but penalty-free since Rodriguez is over 59½',
      'The entire $15,000 is tax-free because Rodriguez is over 59½',
      'The entire $15,000 is taxable as ordinary income',
      'The $12,000 is tax-free; the $3,000 in earnings is both taxable and subject to a 10% penalty',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Roth IRA contributions can always be withdrawn tax-free (they were made with after-tax dollars). Earnings are tax-free only if the distribution is \'qualified\' — meaning the 5-year holding period is met AND the taxpayer is 59½+. Rodriguez is over 59½ but the account is only 3 years old, so the 5-year rule is NOT met. The $3,000 in earnings is taxable as ordinary income but NOT subject to the 10% penalty since Rodriguez is over 59½.',
