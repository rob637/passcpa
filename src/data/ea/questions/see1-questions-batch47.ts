    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The annual gift tax exclusion for 2024 is $18,000 per recipient. With gift-splitting (Form 709 election), each spouse is treated as giving half. Each grandchild receives $22,000 total, but gift-splitting means each spouse is treated as giving $11,000 per grandchild. Since $11,000 is below the $18,000 exclusion, no gift exceeds the exclusion. However, Form 709 must still be filed to elect gift-splitting, even though no taxable gifts result.',
