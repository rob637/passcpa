    explanation: 'TFRP = 100% of unpaid trust fund taxes. Trust fund taxes include: (1) withheld income taxes ($50,000), and (2) employee portion of FICA ($15,000 - which is half of the $30,000 total FICA). If the $30,000 stated is already the employee share, then TFRP = $50,000 + $30,000 = $80,000. If it represents total FICA (both shares), then employee portion = $15,000, and TFRP = $50,000 + $15,000 = $65,000. The question specifies "employee FICA," so TFRP = $50,000 + $30,000 = $80,000.',
