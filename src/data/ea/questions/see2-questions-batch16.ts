    question: 'An S corporation shareholder\'s stock basis is increased by:',
    options: [
      'Their pro rata share of the corporation\'s ordinary income',
      'Nondeductible expenses paid by the corporation',
      'Distributions received from the corporation',
      'Corporation-level tax paid on built-in gains',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1367(a)(1), an S shareholder\'s basis increases by their pro rata share of income (including separately stated items) and tax-exempt income. Distributions, losses, and nondeductible expenses decrease basis.',

    question: 'The order of decreases to an S corporation shareholder\'s basis is:',
    options: [
      'Nondeductible expenses first, then distributions, then losses',
      'Losses first, then distributions, then nondeductible expenses',
      'Distributions first, then losses, then nondeductible expenses',
      'Distributions first, then nondeductible expenses, then losses and deductions',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1367(a)(2), basis is reduced first by distributions, then by nondeductible non-capital expenses, then by losses and deductions. This ordering prevents distributions from creating additional loss limitations.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1366(d)(1)(B), debt basis comes only from direct loans from the shareholder to the corporation. Guarantees, pledges, and third-party loans to the corporation do not create debt basis for the shareholder.',

      '$5,000',
      '$15,000',
      '$10,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1366(d), losses are limited to the shareholder\'s stock basis plus debt basis. A can deduct $15,000 ($10,000 + $5,000). The remaining $5,000 is suspended and carried forward indefinitely.',

      'Basis is never restored once reduced',
      'Income restores stock basis first, then debt basis',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,

      '$30,000 return of capital, $20,000 ordinary income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1368(b), if no E&P exists, distributions are tax-free to the extent of stock basis (return of capital), then any excess is capital gain. Here, $30,000 reduces basis to zero, and $20,000 is capital gain.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1368(c), distributions from an S corp with E&P come first from AAA (tax-free to extent of basis), then from E&P (dividend), then reduce remaining basis. Here: $40,000 from AAA + $30,000 from E&P as dividend.',
