    options: [
      'The fair market value of property distributed',
      'The amount of cash distributed',
      'The corporation\'s current and accumulated earnings and profits (E&P)',
      'The shareholder\'s stock basis',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §316(a), a dividend is any distribution made out of either current E&P (as of close of year) or accumulated E&P. Distributions exceeding E&P are return of capital, then capital gain.',

      'Tax-exempt interest income',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Tax-exempt interest income increases E&P even though it doesn\'t increase taxable income. Federal taxes and dividends paid reduce E&P. Excess capital losses don\'t affect E&P beyond net income.',

    question: 'A C corporation distributes property with FMV of $80,000 and basis of $30,000 to a shareholder. The corporation:',

      'Recognizes $50,000 gain as if the property were sold at FMV',
      'Deducts $50,000 as a dividend expense',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §311(b), when a corporation distributes appreciated property, it recognizes gain as if the property were sold for its FMV. The $50,000 gain ($80,000 - $30,000) is recognized.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §311(a), a corporation does not recognize loss on distributions of depreciated property to shareholders. The loss is effectively disallowed. The shareholder takes a FMV basis.',

      'Is funded by borrowed money',
      'Reduces the shareholder\'s ownership by any percentage',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §302(b), a redemption receives sale treatment (capital gain/loss) if it\'s substantially disproportionate (ownership drops to less than 80% of prior percentage and below 50%), complete termination, or not essentially equivalent to dividend.',

    question: 'Before a redemption, Shareholder A owns 60% of a corporation. After redemption, A owns 35%. Is this substantially disproportionate?',
    options: [
      'No, because A\'s ownership must drop below 50%',
      'Yes, because any reduction qualifies',
      'No, because A still owns more than 20%',
      'Yes, because 35% is less than 80% of 60% (48%) and less than 50%',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §302(b)(2), substantially disproportionate requires: (1) after redemption, ownership < 80% of pre-redemption percentage (35% < 48%), AND (2) ownership < 50%. Both tests are met here.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §318(a)(1), family attribution rules treat stock owned by spouse, children, grandchildren, and parents as owned by the taxpayer. This affects whether a redemption qualifies for sale or exchange treatment.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §302(c)(2), family attribution can be waived for complete terminations if the shareholder files an agreement, doesn\'t acquire any interest (except as creditor) for 10 years, and meets other requirements.',

    correctAnswer: 3,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §312(n)(7), when a redemption is treated as an exchange (not a dividend), E&P is reduced by the lesser of the ratable share of E&P or the amount of the distribution.',
