    question: 'A simple trust had: $30,000 in dividends, $15,000 in tax-exempt interest, and $5,000 in fiduciary fees allocable to all income. All income must be distributed to the sole beneficiary. What is the trust\'s distributable net income (DNI)?',

DNI caps the trust\'s distribution deduction and determines the character of amounts flowing to beneficiaries.',

    options: [
      'The $150,000 is fully taxable as ordinary income to the beneficiary, with no step-up in basis',

      'The beneficiary pays capital gains tax on the $150,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
