    question: 'A sole proprietor reported $182,000 in net self-employment earnings for 2024 and had no W-2 wages. What is the total Social Security and Medicare tax portion of the self-employment tax? (Wage base: $168,600.)',
    options: [
      '$25,574',
      '$27,846',
      '$22,752',
      '$20,866',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'SE tax base = 92.35% × $182,000 = $168,077. Since $168,077 is below the $168,600 wage base, the full amount is subject to both portions. Social Security: 12.4% × $168,077 = $20,842. Medicare: 2.9% × $168,077 = $4,874. Total SE tax = $25,716. Note: at 92.35% × $182,000 = $168,077, the full 15.3% applies: $168,077 × 15.3% = $25,716.',

    question: 'Self-employed consultant Nakamura had net earnings from self-employment of $148,000 in 2024 and no other wages. What is Nakamura\'s self-employment tax? (Social Security wage base: $168,600.)',

      '$22,644',
      '$11,322',
      '$18,612',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'SE tax is calculated on 92.35% of net SE earnings. 92.35% × $148,000 = $136,678. The SE tax rate is 15.3% (12.4% Social Security + 2.9% Medicare). Since $136,678 is below the $168,600 wage base, both portions apply in full: $136,678 × 15.3% = $20,912. The taxpayer may deduct 50% of SE tax as an adjustment to income.',
