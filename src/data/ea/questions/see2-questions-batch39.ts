    question: 'A taxpayer actively participates in a rental real estate activity and has AGI of $85,000 before considering the rental loss. The rental activity generated a $20,000 loss.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §469(i), taxpayers who actively participate in rental real estate may deduct up to $25,000 of rental losses against non-passive income. This allowance phases out between AGI of $100,000–$150,000. Since the taxpayer\'s AGI of $85,000 is below the phase-out threshold, the full $20,000 loss is deductible (within the $25,000 maximum). Active participation requires making management decisions such as approving tenants and setting rent.',
