      'Create net operating losses',
    ],

      'The type of activity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The key factor is whether the activity is engaged in with a genuine expectation of profit. The IRS considers 9 factors including manner of operation, expertise, time devoted, and profit history.',

    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'A taxpayer breeds and sells exotic birds as a side activity, reporting losses for 4 of the past 7 years. The IRS is questioning whether this is a hobby. Under IRC §183, which factor is LEAST relevant to the hobby vs. business determination?',
    options: [
      'Whether the taxpayer finds the activity personally enjoyable',
      'Whether the taxpayer conducts the activity in a businesslike manner with proper records',
      'The expertise of the taxpayer or their advisors in the field',
      'The time and effort devoted to the activity',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'While personal pleasure is one of the nine factors under IRC §183 and Reg. §1.183-2, it is the least determinative. The IRS gives greater weight to factors demonstrating profit motive: businesslike conduct, expertise, time devoted, expectation of asset appreciation, and success in similar activities. The 3-of-5-year profit presumption is a safe harbor, not a definitive test.',

      'Must be capitalized',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Losses during startup are expected for many businesses. A history of losses is only one factor; the IRS considers whether losses were due to circumstances beyond control or early-stage development.',
