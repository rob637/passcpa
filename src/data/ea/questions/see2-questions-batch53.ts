    question: 'A small business earned $45,000 in general business credits during the tax year. The business\'s net regular tax liability (after other credits) is $30,000, and its tentative minimum tax is $22,000. What is the maximum general business credit the business may use this year?',
    options: [
      '$8,000',
      '$30,000',
      '$45,000',
      '$5,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'The general business credit is limited to net income tax minus the greater of tentative minimum tax or 25% of net regular tax liability over $25,000. Limit = $30,000 − greater of ($22,000 or 25% × ($30,000 − $25,000)) = $30,000 − greater of ($22,000 or $1,250) = $30,000 − $22,000 = $8,000. The unused $37,000 can be carried back 1 year and forward 20 years.',
