    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1361, an S corporation cannot have a nonresident alien shareholder. Other requirements: must be a domestic corporation, have no more than 100 shareholders, have only one class of stock, and shareholders must be individuals, estates, certain trusts, or tax-exempt organizations.
