    explanation: 'Partner A\'s basis starts at $60,000 (basis of contributed property). The liability assumed by the partnership reduces A\'s basis by $70,000 (full amount). A\'s share of the partnership liability (50% × $70,000 = $35,000) increases basis. Result: $60,000 - $70,000 + $35,000 = $25,000. Basis cannot go below zero.',

    explanation: 'The IRS scrutinizes S corporation shareholder-employees who pay themselves unreasonably low salaries to avoid FICA/Medicare taxes.
