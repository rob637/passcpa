    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The nonrecognition rule of IRC §721 applies only to contributions of property, not services.

    explanation: 'Under IRC §1402(a), a general partner\'s distributive share of income from a trade or business is subject to self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare).

      'Has more than 100 shareholders',
      'Distributes property to shareholders during liquidation',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1374, the BIG tax applies to S corporations that formerly were C corporations (or received assets from a C corporation in a tax-free transaction). If the S corporation recognizes built-in gains on assets held at the time of conversion during the recognition period (5 years), the gain is subject to the highest corporate tax rate (21%). This prevents C corporations from converting to S status solely to avoid corporate-level tax on appreciated assets.',

      '$20,000',
      '$5,000',
      '$45,000',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'The partner\'s initial basis is the carryover basis of the contributed property ($20,000). The partnership\'s assumption of the $15,000 mortgage is treated as a deemed distribution to the contributing partner. However, the partner also shares in the liability per their partnership interest. Assuming no other partners for simplicity, the net decrease is $15,000, so basis = $20,000 - $15,000 = $5,000.',

      'S corporation',
      'C corporation',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 2,
    explanation: 'A C corporation is subject to double taxation: the corporation pays income tax on its earnings at the corporate level (21%), and shareholders pay income tax on dividends when earnings are distributed. Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and S corporations are pass-through entities where income is taxed only once at the owner level.',

      'A loan to a shareholder with a formal written note and market interest rate',
      'Reimbursement of documented business travel expenses',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'A constructive dividend occurs when a corporation confers an economic benefit on a shareholder that is not formally declared as a dividend. Paying above-market rent (or the excess over fair market rent) to a controlling shareholder for property is a classic example. Other examples include excessive compensation, personal expenses paid by the corporation, and below-market loans.',

      'As capital gains to the partner',
      'As self-employment income only if the partner works more than 500 hours',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §707(c), guaranteed payments to a partner for services are treated as ordinary income to the partner (regardless of partnership income) and are deductible by the partnership in computing ordinary income. They are also subject to self-employment tax. Guaranteed payments are similar to salary payments but are not subject to withholding.',

    explanation: 'Under the check-the-box regulations (Treas. Reg. §301.7701-3), a domestic entity with two or more members that does not elect otherwise is classified by default as a partnership.

    explanation: 'An S corporation shareholder may deduct losses up to the combined basis in stock and direct loans (debt basis) to the corporation. Stock basis: $10,000 + Debt basis: $5,000 = $15,000 maximum deduction. The remaining $3,000 loss is suspended and carried forward.
