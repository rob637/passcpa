    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under MACRS, the half-year convention applies to most tangible personal property (equipment, furniture, vehicles, etc.) placed in service during the year. This convention treats the property as placed in service at the midpoint of the year, allowing a half-year of depreciation in the first and last years. The mid-quarter convention applies instead if more than 40% of property is placed in service in the last quarter.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1231, if Section 1231 gains exceed Section 1231 losses for the year, the net gain is treated as long-term capital gain, eligible for preferential tax rates. However, if Section 1231 losses exceed gains, the net loss is treated as an ordinary loss. This is the "best of both worlds" rule. The 5-year lookback rule may recharacterize some gain as ordinary.',

    explanation: 'Under current law (post-TCJA, effective for tax years beginning after 2017), a partnership terminates for tax purposes only when no part of any business, financial operation, or venture of the partnership continues to be carried on by any partner.

Additionally, under IRC §1375, a tax is imposed on excess net passive income in each year the 25% threshold is exceeded. This can be avoided by distributing the accumulated E&P.',

    explanation: 'When a corporation has an unusually high debt-to-equity ratio (thin capitalization), the IRS may recharacterize the purported debt as equity under IRC §385.

    question: 'A partnership must generally adopt the same tax year as its:',
    options: [
      'Founding partner',
      'Partners owning a majority interest (majority interest tax year)',
      'State of formation',
      'Primary bank',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §706(b), a partnership must generally use the tax year of its majority-interest partners (partners owning more than 50% of profits and capital). If there is no majority interest tax year, the partnership must use the tax year of all principal partners. If neither rule determines a year, the partnership must use the year that produces the least aggregate deferral. A Section 444 election may allow a different year.',
