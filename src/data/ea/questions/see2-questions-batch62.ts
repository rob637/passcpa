    options: [
      'The worker uses their own tools and equipment',
      'The business controls when, where, and how the work is performed',
      'The worker sets their own schedule',
      'The worker provides services to multiple clients',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The IRS uses common-law rules to determine worker classification, focusing on the degree of control and independence. Behavioral control (when, where, and how work is performed) is a primary factor. Other factors include financial control (how the worker is paid, expense reimbursement) and the type of relationship (written contracts, benefits). Workers who control their own methods are more likely independent contractors.',

    question: 'Health insurance premiums paid by an S corporation on behalf of a more-than-2% shareholder-employee are:',
    options: [
      'Excluded from the shareholder\'s income as a tax-free fringe benefit',
      'Included in the shareholder\'s W-2 wages but not subject to FICA taxes',
      'Deductible by the S corporation but taxable as a guaranteed payment',
      'Nondeductible by both the corporation and the shareholder',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1372, a more-than-2% S corporation shareholder is treated like a partner for fringe benefit purposes. Health insurance premiums paid by the S corporation must be included in the shareholder-employee\'s W-2 wages (Box 1) but are generally not subject to FICA taxes. The shareholder may then deduct the premiums as a self-employed health insurance deduction (above-the-line) on their personal return.',
