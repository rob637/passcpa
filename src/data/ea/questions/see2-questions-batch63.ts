    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §163(j), as amended by the TCJA, the deduction for business interest expense is limited to business interest income plus 30% of adjusted taxable income (ATI). For tax years beginning after 2021, ATI is computed without adding back depreciation, amortization, and depletion. Small businesses (average gross receipts of $30 million or less) are generally exempt from this limitation.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §195, a taxpayer may deduct up to $5,000 of startup costs in the year the business begins operations. The $5,000 deduction is reduced dollar-for-dollar for startup costs exceeding $50,000. Since $42,000 is under $50,000, the full $5,000 immediate deduction is available. The remaining $37,000 is amortized over 180 months beginning in the month active business starts.',
