    explanation: 'Under IRC §1367 and Treas. Reg. §1.1367-1(f), an S corporation shareholder\'s stock basis is adjusted annually in the following order: (1) increased for income items (separately and nonseparately stated income); (2) increased for the excess of deductions for depletion over basis of the property; (3) decreased (but not below zero) for nondividend distributions; (4) decreased for nondeductible, noncapital expenses and depletion; (5) decreased for items of loss and deduction (limited to remaining basis).',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1374, a C corporation that converts to S status is subject to the built-in gains tax at the corporate rate (currently 21%) on net recognized built-in gain from assets that had appreciation on the date of conversion, if the gain is recognized during the recognition period (5 years from the effective date of the S election). The BIG tax applies only to the excess of gain over the net unrealized built-in gain at conversion. Any BIG tax paid flows through to shareholders as a separately stated item.',

    explanation: 'Under IRC §751, hot assets include unrealized receivables (including certain recapture items under IRC §1245 and §1250) and inventory items (substantially appreciated or not). When a partner sells/exchanges a partnership interest, the portion of gain attributable to hot assets is treated as ordinary income, not capital gain.

    correctAnswer: 1,

In an S corporation, only the shareholder-employee\'s reasonable salary (W-2 wages) is subject to FICA taxes. Distributions of remaining profits to the shareholder are not subject to self-employment or FICA tax. However, the IRS requires that the salary be "reasonable" — setting an unreasonably low salary to avoid FICA taxes may result in recharacterization of distributions as wages.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The AAA is a corporate-level account that tracks the cumulative total of undistributed net income of the S corporation since 1983 (or since the S election became effective). It is increased by income items and decreased by losses, deductions, nondeductible expenses, and distributions. The AAA is important for S corporations with accumulated E&P from prior C corporation years — distributions from AAA are tax-free (return of previously taxed income), while distributions exceeding AAA from E&P are taxed as dividends.',

    explanation: 'Under IRC §754, a partnership may elect to adjust the basis of partnership property upon the transfer of a partnership interest (IRC §743(b) — optional basis adjustment) or upon a distribution of property (IRC §734(b)). The §743(b) adjustment links the inside basis of the partnership\'s assets to the new partner\'s outside basis (purchase price).

An LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership by default. Either type may elect to be classified as a corporation by filing Form 8832 (Entity Classification Election).

    options: [
      'The corporation\'s cash balance',
      'The corporation\'s current and accumulated earnings and profits (E&P)',
      'The shareholder\'s basis in the stock',
      'The corporation\'s gross revenue',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §316, a dividend is any distribution of property from a corporation to its shareholders out of either current earnings and profits (current year E&P) or accumulated earnings and profits (E&P from prior years). Distributions are sourced first from current E&P, then from accumulated E&P. Distributions exceeding total E&P are treated as return of capital (reducing stock basis), and amounts exceeding basis are treated as capital gain.',

    question: 'Under current law (post-TCJA), a partnership terminates for tax purposes when:',
    options: [
      '50% or more of partnership interests are transferred within 12 months',
      'No part of any business, financial operation, or venture of the partnership continues to be carried on by any of its partners',
      'The managing partner resigns',
      'Two or more partners disagree on operations',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under the TCJA amendments to IRC §708(b), the "technical termination" rule (when 50% or more of interests were transferred in 12 months) was repealed for partnership tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Now, a partnership terminates for tax purposes only when no part of any business, financial operation, or venture of the partnership continues to be carried on by any partner in a partnership. This simplification eliminated many unintended termination consequences.',

    question: 'An S corporation with accumulated E&P from C corporation years faces what consequence if its passive investment income exceeds 25% of gross receipts for three consecutive years?',
    options: [
      'Nothing — S corporations are never affected by passive income',
      'The S corporation election is automatically terminated, and the corporation reverts to C corporation status',
      'The corporation must pay a special penalty tax',
      'The shareholders must pay an additional 10% surtax',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1362(d)(3), if an S corporation has accumulated E&P (from prior C corporation years) and passive investment income (rents, royalties, dividends, interest, annuities, gains from sales of securities) exceeding 25% of gross receipts for three consecutive tax years, the S election is automatically terminated at the beginning of the fourth year. Additionally, under IRC §1375, an excess net passive income tax (at the 21% corporate rate) is imposed for each year that the passive income exceeds 25% of gross receipts while there is accumulated E&P.',

    options: [
      'Is treated the same as any other partner with no special rules',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §704(e), family partnerships are subject to special rules. A donee family member is recognized as a partner if capital is a material income-producing factor and the donee has genuine ownership and control. The donor-partner must be allocated reasonable compensation for services rendered to the partnership before allocating income between the partners. The donee\'s share of income cannot exceed the proportionate share based on the donated capital interest.',
