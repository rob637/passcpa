    question: 'Under IRC §368(a), which of the following is a Type A reorganization?',
    options: [
      'A stock redemption',
      'A statutory merger or consolidation under state law',
      'A transfer of assets for stock in a newly formed corporation',
      'A simple purchase of a corporation\'s assets for cash',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §368(a)(1)(A), a Type A reorganization is a statutory merger or consolidation effected under applicable state law (or federal law or the law of a foreign jurisdiction). In a merger, one corporation absorbs another; in a consolidation, two corporations combine to form a new entity. Key requirements include continuity of interest (significant portion of consideration must be stock) and continuity of business enterprise. Type A reorganizations offer the most flexibility in consideration types.',

    question: 'When a C corporation completely liquidates under IRC §331, shareholders generally:',
    options: [
      'Report the distribution as ordinary income',
      'Treat the liquidating distribution as full payment in exchange for their stock, recognizing capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the distribution amount and their stock basis',
      'Do not recognize any gain or loss',
      'Report the distribution as a dividend',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §331, amounts received by a shareholder in a complete liquidation of a corporation are treated as full payment in exchange for the stock. The shareholder recognizes capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount received (FMV of property plus cash) and the shareholder\'s adjusted basis in the stock. Under IRC §336, the liquidating corporation recognizes gain or loss on the distribution of property as if it sold the property at FMV.',

    options: [
      'Recognizes gain on the received assets',
      'Recognizes no gain or loss; the subsidiary\'s asset bases carry over to the parent',
      'Must pay a special liquidation tax',
      'Recognizes loss on the received assets',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §332, when a parent corporation (owning 80% or more of the subsidiary\'s stock) liquidates the subsidiary, the parent recognizes no gain or loss. Under IRC §334(b)(1), the parent takes a carryover basis in the subsidiary\'s assets. The subsidiary also recognizes no gain or loss on distributions to the 80% parent under IRC §337. However, the subsidiary does recognize gain (not loss) on distributions to minority shareholders. The parent also inherits the subsidiary\'s tax attributes (NOLs, E&P, etc.) under IRC §381.',

    question: 'When a C corporation elects S corporation status, which of the following tax consequences should be considered?',
    options: [
      'All accumulated E&P is immediately distributed and taxed',
      'Built-in gains tax on appreciated assets, LIFO recapture tax, passive investment income tax on accumulated E&P, and accounting method changes',
      'No tax consequences — the conversion is seamless',
      'The corporation must liquidate and reform',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Converting from C to S status triggers several considerations: (1) the built-in gains (BIG) tax under IRC §1374 on net unrealized appreciation within 5 years; (2) LIFO recapture — if the corporation used LIFO inventory, it must include the LIFO reserve in income in the last C corporation year (IRC §1363(d)); (3) excess passive income tax under IRC §1375 if passive income exceeds 25% of gross receipts while accumulated E&P exists; and (4) potential accounting method changes.

      'The partnership has an overall loss for the year',

      'The partnership files a special election',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §731(a)(2), a partner may recognize a loss on a liquidating distribution only if the distribution consists solely of cash, unrealized receivables, and/or inventory items, and the total amount of cash plus the basis of the receivables and inventory is less than the partner\'s outside basis. The loss is a capital loss. If any other property is distributed, no loss may be recognized — instead, the partner takes a substituted basis in the property.',

    question: 'For a stock redemption to qualify for sale or exchange treatment (capital gain) rather than dividend treatment, it must meet one of the tests under IRC §302(b). Which of the following qualifies?',
    options: [
      'Any repurchase of stock by the corporation',
      'A substantially disproportionate redemption (shareholder\'s ownership drops below 80% of pre-redemption percentage and below 50% total voting power)',
      'A redemption that increases the shareholder\'s ownership percentage',
      'A redemption using borrowed funds',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §302(b)(2), a substantially disproportionate redemption qualifies for sale/exchange treatment if, after the redemption: (1) the shareholder owns less than 50% of the total combined voting power, and (2) the shareholder\'s percentage of voting stock is less than 80% of their pre-redemption percentage. Other qualifying tests include: a complete termination of interest (§302(b)(3)), a redemption not essentially equivalent to a dividend (§302(b)(1)), or a partial liquidation (§302(b)(4)).',

      'The shareholder owns less than 50% of the stock',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'The IRS scrutinizes S corporations where shareholder-employees receive minimal or no salary while taking significant distributions. Under IRC §7436, the IRS may recharacterize distributions as wages subject to FICA and income tax withholding if the compensation is not reasonable for the services provided. Factors considered include: training and experience, duties and responsibilities, comparable salaries, time devoted, dividend history, and compensation agreements.',

    options: [
      'The partner contributes property and receives an equal value distribution within 2 years, and the distribution would not have been made but for the contribution',
      'The partner receives any guaranteed payment',
      'The partner contributes services',
      'The partner borrows money from the partnership',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §707(a)(2)(B) and Treas. Reg. §1.707-3, a contribution of property by a partner followed by a related distribution from the partnership (or vice versa) may be treated as a disguised sale if, viewed together, the transfer and distribution are properly characterized as a sale. If a distribution occurs within 2 years of a contribution, there is a presumption of a disguised sale. Factors include: the timing and amount of the distribution, the entrepreneurial risks borne, and whether the distribution would have occurred regardless.',

    explanation: 'The Section 199A deduction is available to noncorporate taxpayers with qualified business income from pass-through entities, including S corporations, partnerships, sole proprietorships, and certain trusts and estates. The deduction is generally 20% of QBI, subject to limitations based on taxable income, W-2 wages paid, and the unadjusted basis of qualified property.

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §1372, a more-than-2% S corporation shareholder is treated like a partner for purposes of fringe benefits. Health insurance premiums paid by the S corporation must be included in the shareholder-employee\'s W-2 wages (Box 1 only — not subject to FICA). The shareholder may then claim the self-employed health insurance deduction on Line 17 of Schedule 1 (Form 1040), which is an above-the-line deduction. This effectively makes the premium deductible but through a different mechanism than for C corporation shareholder-employees.',
