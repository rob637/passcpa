    question: 'A taxpayer owes $28,000 in back taxes and has monthly income of $2,800 with monthly living expenses of $2,750. The taxpayer has no significant assets. What IRS collection alternative is most appropriate?',
    options: [
      'Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status because the taxpayer cannot pay and meet basic living expenses',
      'An installment agreement with monthly payments of $50',
      'An offer in compromise based on doubt as to collectibility',
      'Voluntary bankruptcy filing to discharge the tax debt',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Currently Not Collectible (CNC) status is appropriate when a taxpayer\'s allowable expenses meet or exceed income, making collection impractical. With only $50 monthly surplus, the IRS may classify the account as CNC. While in CNC status, the IRS suspends active collection efforts but penalties and interest continue to accrue, and the collection statute (CSED) continues to run. The IRS periodically reviews CNC accounts for changed circumstances.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
