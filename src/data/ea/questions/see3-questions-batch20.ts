    question: 'A taxpayer files Form 4868 to obtain an automatic filing extension but does not pay any estimated tax with the form. The taxpayer owes $5,000. Which of the following statements is correct?',
    options: [
      'The extension is valid for filing, but the taxpayer will owe failure-to-pay penalties and interest from the original due date',
      'The extension is invalid because payment must accompany Form 4868',
      'No penalties or interest apply as long as the return is filed by the extended deadline',
      'The extension is automatically denied without payment',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Form 4868 provides a valid automatic filing extension regardless of whether payment accompanies it. However, it is only an extension of time to file, not an extension of time to pay. The unpaid $5,000 will accrue failure-to-pay penalties (0.5% per month, max 25%) and interest from the original due date (April 15). Filing the extension avoids the more costly failure-to-file penalty.',

    correctAnswer: 2,

      'Form 1040-X; yes, the claim is timely because it is within 3 years of the original filing date',
      'Form 1040-X; no, the claim is untimely because only 2 years are allowed',
      'Form 843; yes, if filed within 1 year',
      'No form is needed — the IRS automatically corrects overpayments',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Form 1040-X (Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return) is used to correct errors on previously filed returns. A claim for refund must be filed within the later of 3 years from the date the return was filed or 2 years from the date the tax was paid.
