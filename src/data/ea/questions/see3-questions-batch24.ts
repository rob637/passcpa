    difficulty: 'medium',
    skillLevel: 'Remembering and Understanding',
    question: 'The IRS filed a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) against a taxpayer who owes $42,000 in assessed taxes. What is the effect of filing the NFTL?',
    options: [
      'It establishes the government\'s priority over other creditors by providing public notice of the lien',
      'It authorizes the IRS to seize the taxpayer\'s property immediately',
      'It prevents the taxpayer from selling any assets without IRS approval',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'A Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) provides public notice of the government\'s lien on the taxpayer\'s property, establishing priority over subsequent creditors. The lien itself arises automatically under IRC §6321 when taxes are assessed and the taxpayer fails to pay after demand. The NFTL does not authorize seizure — that requires a levy. The taxpayer may request withdrawal of the NFTL or subordination in certain circumstances.',
