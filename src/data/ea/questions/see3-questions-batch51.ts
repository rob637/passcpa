    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'A federal tax lien under IRC §6321 is a legal claim against all property and rights to property to secure payment of the tax debt. It does not seize property — it establishes the government\'s priority. A levy under IRC §6331 is the actual seizure of property (wages, bank accounts, real estate, etc.) to satisfy the tax debt.

      'Equitable relief under IRC §6015(f)',
      'Injured spouse allocation using Form 8379',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Separation of liability under §6015(c) is ideal when the requesting spouse is divorced or legally separated and the understatement is attributable to the other spouse. It allocates the deficiency as if separate returns were filed. Since the requesting spouse had no involvement in the ex-spouse\'s business and is now divorced, §6015(c) allocates the $60,000 entirely to the ex-spouse. This differs from §6015(b) which completely relieves liability.',

    question: 'A taxpayer filed a return reporting $90,000 in income. The IRS determines the correct income was $160,000, resulting in a $17,500 understatement of tax. The total tax on the correct return is $28,000. Does a substantial understatement penalty under IRC §6662(d) apply?',

      'Yes, because the understatement of $17,500 exceeds the greater of 10% of the correct tax ($2,800) or $5,000',
      'No, because the understatement is less than $25,000',
      'Yes, but only if the taxpayer acted with willful intent',
      'No, because the understatement must exceed 25% of the correct tax',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'A substantial understatement exists when the understatement exceeds the greater of 10% of the tax required to be shown on the return or $5,000 ($10,000 for C corporations). Here, 10% × $28,000 = $2,800; greater of $2,800 or $5,000 = $5,000. The understatement of $17,500 exceeds $5,000, so the 20% accuracy-related penalty applies: 20% × $17,500 = $3,500.',
