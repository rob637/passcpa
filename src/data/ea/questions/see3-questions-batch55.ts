    question: 'A taxpayer requests relief from joint and several liability for a $45,000 tax deficiency arising from their former spouse\'s unreported income on a joint return filed 3 years ago. The taxpayer had no knowledge of the unreported income and received no benefit from it. Which form of innocent spouse relief most likely applies?',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 0,
    explanation: 'Traditional innocent spouse relief under IRC §6015(b) applies when: (1) a joint return was filed, (2) there is an understatement attributable to the other spouse\'s erroneous items, (3) the requesting spouse did not know and had no reason to know, and (4) it would be inequitable to hold them liable. Since the taxpayer had no knowledge and received no benefit, §6015(b) is the most appropriate remedy.',
