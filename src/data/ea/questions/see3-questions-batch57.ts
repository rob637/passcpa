    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §7122, an Offer in Compromise may be submitted on three grounds: (1) Doubt as to Liability — legitimate doubt the assessed tax is correct; (2) Doubt as to Collectibility — the taxpayer\'s assets and income are insufficient to pay the full amount; (3) Effective Tax Administration (ETA) — no doubt about liability or collectibility, but collection would create economic hardship or be detrimental to voluntary compliance.',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §6325(d), the IRS may issue a certificate of subordination, which makes the federal tax lien secondary (junior) to another creditor\'s lien. This is often requested when a taxpayer needs to refinance a mortgage — the mortgage lender requires that its lien be senior to the federal tax lien. The IRS will subordinate if doing so will ultimately facilitate collection of the tax (e.g., the taxpayer will use refinance proceeds to pay the tax).',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §6159(a), a Partial Payment Installment Agreement allows a taxpayer to make monthly payments that will not fully satisfy the tax liability before the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED).

    question: 'If a taxpayer fails to file a required return, the IRS may prepare a Substitute for Return (SFR) under:',
    options: [
      'IRC §6651',
      'IRC §6020(b)',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §6020(b), when a taxpayer fails to file a required return, the IRS may prepare a Substitute for Return. The SFR is typically based on information available to the IRS (W-2s, 1099s) and usually does not include deductions, exemptions, or credits the taxpayer may be entitled to. The taxpayer has the right to file their own return at any time, which will replace the SFR and may result in a lower tax liability.',
