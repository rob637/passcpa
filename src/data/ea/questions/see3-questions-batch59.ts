    explanation: 'Under IRC §6303, after assessment, the IRS must send a notice and demand for payment to the taxpayer within 60 days. For individual income tax, the initial billing notice is typically a CP14 (Balance Due notice). The notice identifies the tax period, amount owed, and the deadline for payment.

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Form 872 is used when both the taxpayer and the IRS agree to extend the time for assessing tax. This is commonly done when an examination is still in progress and the normal 3-year statute is about to expire. Form 872 extends the statute for a fixed period, while Form 872-A provides an open-ended (indefinite) extension.
