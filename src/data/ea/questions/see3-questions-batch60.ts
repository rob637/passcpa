      'Is continuous and attaches to all future wage payments until the levy is released',
      'Requires a new notice for each pay period',

    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §6331(e), a levy on wages, salary, and other income is continuous from the date the levy is served until the levy is released. This means the employer must continue to pay the levied portion of each paycheck to the IRS until the IRS formally releases the levy. In contrast, a levy on a bank account is a one-time levy that attaches only to funds in the account on the date the levy is served.',

    explanation: 'Under IRC §6332(c), when the IRS serves a levy on a bank, the bank must hold the funds in the account (as of the date of the levy) for 21 days before remitting them to the IRS. This 21-day holding period gives the taxpayer time to resolve the matter — by contacting the IRS, setting up a payment arrangement, or demonstrating that the levy creates a hardship. After 21 days, the bank sends the funds to the IRS.',

The action must be filed within 9 months from the date of the levy. Alternatively, the third party may file an administrative claim with the IRS before the 9-month period expires.
