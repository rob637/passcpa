    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'For income tax debt to be dischargeable in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the following must generally be met: (1) the return was due at least 3 years before the bankruptcy petition was filed (the "3-year rule"); (2) the return was actually filed at least 2 years before the petition date (the "2-year rule"); (3) the tax was assessed at least 240 days before the petition date (the "240-day rule"); and (4) the return was not fraudulent, and there was no willful evasion.

However, the IRS may still: (1) issue a notice of tax deficiency, (2) demand a tax return, (3) make an assessment, (4) issue a demand for payment, and (5) offset a pre-petition tax against a pre-petition refund.

    explanation: 'Under IRC §6501(e)(1)(A), the statute of limitations for assessment is extended to 6 years (from the normal 3 years) when the taxpayer omits from gross income an amount that exceeds 25% of the gross income stated on the return. For example, if a taxpayer reports $100,000 of gross income but actually had $130,000, the $30,000 omission exceeds 25% ($25,000), triggering the 6-year statute.
