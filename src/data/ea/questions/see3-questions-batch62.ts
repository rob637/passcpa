    question: 'When the IRS grants a filing and payment deadline extension due to a federally declared disaster:',
    options: [
      'Taxpayers must individually apply for the extension',
      'Affected taxpayers automatically receive the extension — penalties and interest for the postponement period are abated',
      'Only businesses receive the extension',
      'The extension applies only to filing, not payment',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §7508A, when the President declares a federal disaster, the IRS may postpone filing deadlines, payment deadlines, and other tax-related acts for taxpayers in the affected area. The extension is automatic — affected taxpayers do not need to contact the IRS or file a form. Penalties and interest for the postponement period are abated. The IRS announces the affected areas and postponed deadlines through news releases and notices.',
