    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §6511(a), a claim for refund must be filed within 3 years from the time the original return was filed, or 2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever is later. If filed within the 3-year period, the refund is limited to the tax paid within that 3-year period plus any extensions. If filed within the 2-year period (but not the 3-year period), the refund is limited to the amount paid during the 2-year period. A special 7-year rule applies for bad debts and worthless securities.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'An IP PIN is a 6-digit number that helps prevent identity thieves from filing fraudulent tax returns using a victim\'s Social Security number. The IRS issues IP PINs to confirmed identity theft victims. Any taxpayer can now voluntarily opt in to the IP PIN program through their IRS Online Account. The IP PIN must be included on any federal return (paper or electronic). If a return is filed without the correct IP PIN, it will be rejected (e-file) or subject to additional processing delays (paper).',

    question: 'A taxpayer files Form 4868 for an automatic extension but does not pay the estimated tax due. Which statement is correct?',
    options: [
      'The extension is automatically denied',
      'The extension to file is still valid, but the taxpayer may be subject to the failure-to-pay penalty and interest on unpaid tax from the original due date',
      'No penalties apply because the extension was filed',
      'The IRS will grant an additional payment extension',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Filing Form 4868 extends the time to file but NOT the time to pay. Even with a valid extension, if the taxpayer does not pay at least 90% of the tax shown on the return by the original due date (April 15), they may be subject to: (1) the failure-to-pay penalty of 0.5% per month (reduced to 0.25% per month while the extension is in effect for amounts paid by the extended due date), and (2) interest on the unpaid balance from the original due date. The extension itself remains valid regardless of payment.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Under IRC §6033, most tax-exempt organizations must file an annual information return. Organizations with gross receipts normally greater than $50,000 must file Form 990 or Form 990-EZ. Organizations with gross receipts normally $50,000 or less may file Form 990-N (e-Postcard).

    explanation: 'Under IRC §6011(e)(3), as amended by the Taxpayer First Act, any specified tax return preparer who reasonably expects to file more than 10 individual income tax returns during the calendar year must e-file those returns. The threshold was reduced from 11 to 10 returns starting in 2024. A taxpayer may opt out of e-filing by completing a written election. The preparer must retain the opt-out election for 3 years. Failure to e-file when required may result in a $260 penalty per return.',

    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'For 2024, the annual gift tax exclusion is $18,000 per donee. A donor must file Form 709 for gifts to any one individual exceeding $18,000 (or for any gifts of future interests regardless of amount). Gifts between spouses who are U.S. citizens are generally exempt under the unlimited marital deduction. Form 709 is due on April 15, or October 15 with an extension (the extension is automatic if the donor files Form 4868 for their income tax return). Gift-splitting between married couples also requires filing Form 709.',
