    question: 'Which of the following BEST describes referential integrity in a relational database?',
    options: [
      'Ensuring that all data is encrypted at rest',
      'Ensuring that foreign key values match existing primary key values',
      'Ensuring that all tables have a primary key defined',
      'Ensuring that database backups are performed regularly',
    ],
    correctAnswer: 1,
    explanation: 'Referential integrity ensures that relationships between tables remain consistent. A foreign key in one table must reference a valid primary key in another table, or be null. This prevents orphaned records.',
